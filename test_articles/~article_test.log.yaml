    title: "Vis Viva and Imponderable Fluids: Thoughts on Science Literacy"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - AntoineLaurent Lavoisier
    - Science literacy or rather the lack of it surfaced again last week with press reports of recent college graduates unable to explain as were their peers in a famous Harvard survey that changes in the seasons are a result of the Earths tilt not its distance from the sun
    - Fears about the metastasizing of Americas scientific ignorance have been growing for the last years with good reason The most recent surveys from various scientific organizations reveal that only a third of our fellow citizens can explain what studying something scientifically means Most cannot define a molecule Onethird of Americans also reject evolution outright putting this country in a virtual tie with Turkey
    - We can of course quibble about what constitutes scientific literacy Name the noble gases or Does phlogiston exist and who or what is to blame for public ignorance But before pointing too many fingers keep in mind that a ResearchAmerica study found that percent of scientists did not engage in public outreach of any kind in large part because they were too busy or didnt care
    - So what standards can we use to judge science literacy A quick Internet search reveals a number of differently worded but reasonable examples Here are just a few
    - Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz
    - Writers like me who have made their careers reporting and to a degree canonizing science are presumed to be scientifically literate And truth be told most do not disappoint For some literacy is a matter of previous scientific training For others who come to science writing through other doors I was a history and political science major for example literacy comes through osmosis repetition and frequent refreshers
    - Science for me was an acquired taste So I look for primers that excite my curiosity and serve as quick reference texts Some of the best are edited for curious adolescents My particular favorite found on a sale table a couple of years ago is called Science Explorer part of an Eyewitness Books series originally printed in England by Dorling Kindersley
    - Divided into large topic chapters Energy Light Chemistry Force and Motion with double spreads on specific areas What Drives a Reaction Particles and Waves Circuits and Conductors Electricity and Medicine the book is richly illustrated fully crossreferenced and divided into factoids about the irregular backandforth of scientific discovery that even the easily bored would find hard to resist
    - Alchemical vessels from Alchemia Andreas Libavius
    - While Lavoisier was killed because he was an aristocrat and the beneficiary of tax collections and not because he was a scientist the fact remains that science will always be political because collectively it is something of a vis viva And living forces by their nature stir change challenge the status quo and make us think
    - Clearly not everyone thinks that science is worth the trouble or relevant to his or her life But we cannot throw in the towel It is the responsibility of scientists and science writers to keep explaining what scientists do why its important why science sometimes gets it wrong those imponderable fluids again and yes why its exciting Maybe then we will nurture the kind of curiosity about the world that will make the public eager to know more
    - Design for a chemical institute from Andreas Libavius Alchemia The main chemical laboratory in the far left of the lower image includes three furnaces for waterbaths ashbaths and steambaths distillation and sublimation apparatuses and a fireplace An analytical laboratory houses assay furnaces and analytical balances while a philosophers furnace is located in a third private laboratory Other rooms in the institute include a pharmacy coagulatorium storage cellars for food and wine bedrooms and bathroom with gardens alum and vitriol production facilities and a saltpeter plantation on the grounds From The Alchemy Website

    title: Max Seibold, Scientist and Oklahoman
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Max Seibold
    - Max Seibold is not a professors son he will tell you Out of context it is a curious statement but one you soon learn is rooted in humility not defensiveness
    - You see yearold Max Seibold thirdyear UCSF graduate student studying genetics is a native of Lawton Oklahoma That means he carries state pride in his pockets the way some people carry change It is a pride of place that sticks with you because it shaped you and no matter how far away you move or how high you ascend the smell sounds and feel of freshly tilled earth running cattle and harvested cotton brand you forever as a son of the soil
    - Seibolds world now consists of bridge commutes and sterile laboratories but there is no denying a work ethic and a certain stubbornness of purpose that grew as he did from child to young father of two Seibold grandson of a dairy farmer and son of a rancher had a different career in mind
    - He wanted to be a pharmacist and in his singleminded pursuit of that dream stumbled into an organic chemistry course while attending college at Southwestern Oklahoma State He struggled then pulled out a B an experience that together with encouragement from his chemistry professor Allen Lane PhD altered the arc of his life
    - I realized I could achieve something Seibold says Inside I always wanted to do science And science he has done despite acknowledging that when he arrived at UCSF with a degree in chemistry he had little genetics background What he did possess was a deep longing for Northern California and UCSF a legacy school Indeed when he was preparing for his graduate school entrance exams he even used a picture of the Transamerica Building as motivation
    - In the years since his arrival in the Bay Area Seibold has decided upon his quest to understand the genetics of asthma risk and the differential response to asthma drugs among ethnic populations He has his sights set on an academic science career the kind of principal investigator track that so many want and so few achieve
    - To make the grade you have to make an impression and Seibold has definitely done that Here are what two prominent UCSF researchers asthma specialist Esteban Burchard MD and microbiology and immunology expert Richard Locksley MD have to say about the young man logging long hours at their lab benches
    - Max is hardworking extremely selfmotivated and possesses a level of maturity far beyond his years says Burchard He thinks much more broadly than a typical graduate student and is now tops in his class Considering that he does not come from a blueblood research background his achievements are all that more impressive
    - Locksley is equally complimentary Max is a genetics student who has been working with potential susceptibility loci for asthma among various Hispanic populations Although he could find linkages I think he was frustrated that proving causality was difficult He approached me about studying one of these an enzyme by expressing each of the variants of the human gene as based on the sequence polymorphisms He then tested the expressed enzymes to see whether they had different biochemical characteristics
    - His objective Put simply Seibold wants to determine whether the reason for the genetic risk he has observed is due to some enzymes performing their biological functions better or worse than others
    - Typically says Locksley Seibold has encountered all the difficulties that arise when you go to the bench to study very basic things But he adds Seibold has demonstrated great perseverance He has expressed each of the human variants and worked out biologic assays for testing each of them under very controlled conditions He is a very committed guy and really wants to make a difference in understanding this complex human disease
    - Seibold is far too modest to trumpet his success Nor does he abjure his roots Im just a country boy I didnt know any of this could happen
    - Still what urban natives often forget is that while Seibold might not have been cut out to show cattle or work with animals he is still an Oklahoma guy who makes regular visits home and who acknowledges that his inherent conservatism sometimes clashes with the Bay Areas prevailing cultural winds
    - I sometimes feel out of place here or at odds he admits but occasional disenchantment pales besides the opportunities which include nonscientific ones like the regions many hiking trails Im a fanatic hiker
    - As for his dream of being a pharmacist well he didnt exactly walk away from that career either his wife is a practicing pharmacist in the East Bay In short Seibold is just another and frequently overlooked example of the fact that when it comes to students UCSF often gets as good as it gives

    paragraphs: 
    - Chao Tang
    - In the first installment of my conversation with Chao Tang PhD a professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences as well as a QB faculty affiliate we discussed how biological systems are a talking community and that the emerging field of systems biology seeks to uncover not only who talks to whom but how the messages are being communicated and how they mobilize the community into action Moreover Tang asserts biology is on the verge of an intellectual explosion similar to that which occurred within astronomy in the s when the laws of planetary motion and gravity were postulated and proved
    - Scientific revolutions of course do not begin at the barricades but at the lab benches and computer stations And it is there that Tangs work has demonstrated a simple but powerful truth
    - Evolution it seems has put a priority on exactitude and dynamism often in the same system
    - The cells that make up a system operate in a dense dynamic and fluctuating environment says Tang To make sense of how cells work requires that Tang ask three fundamental questions What is responsible for robust function that interplay of hard wiring and dynamism a folding chain of proteins comes to mind Or to approach the matter differently if Tang were starting from scratch how would he wire a system to produce these kinds of fixed and fluid properties And how would he then test his assumptions experimentally
    - This is the region where mathematics reigns where nonlinear dynamic systems theory and its various equations attempt to map out and make sense of the fluctuating some might say chaotic business of a living organism In some ways it is akin to observing all the moving parts of an urban transportation system including its passengers assigning numerical values to everything then selectively shutting down different routes or following subsets of passengers throughout the day and altering your equations based on the results Thats not to mention keeping track of other intersecting system variables such as the weather taxi strikes and changing gasoline supplies
    - Theres always this backandforth between your predictions and your data which we use to improve our models Tang explains The changes spark new questions new thoughts and new experiments Why is it wired this way What can I perturb the next time What are the potential drug targets And did the results shed light on other systems Its a coevolutionary process he emphasizes
    - It is also a longrange one Some of Tangs modelers and experimentalists are based at Peking University necessitating a steady stream of almost daily emails from September through May during the UCSF academic year when he is based in San Francisco
    - The physical distance and the demanding nature of the science could be a recipe for confusion But Tang has hit upon his own simple and powerful truth You learn the most when you learn how to simplify complicated multilevel diagrams to isolate the key elements of a system he says A case in point is yeast or more precisely the cell cycle regulation system in yeast which ensures that yeast buds and divides
    - A The cellcycle network of the budding yeast B Simplified cellcycle network with only one checkpoint cell size See larger
    - About of a yeast cells genes are involved its cell cycle Tang and his team first narrowed the list of key regulators to about a dozen and have since trimmed this list to three regulatory modules that as he explains capture the essence In doing so he also discovered a mathematical meaning for the checkpoints which yeast has incorporated into its division process to ensure order If there is the slightest misstep a red light comes on and the whole system is lured to a rest stop until things are in order again Thats why the yeast cell cycle rarely makes mistakes he adds
    - Math and engineering are not typically the stuff of fancy But Tang has a way of describing his work that makes it all seem well fun Perhaps it is because he is a physicist who found his way to biology through play at the NEC Research Institute based at Princeton When I say play Im not talking sports or cards here but the kind of openended freethinking the opposite of daydreaming that encourages ideas connections and insights to bubble up into the conscious mind
    - For the years I worked there to I was never asked what I did or pressured about grants or committees In fact there was no pressure at all Tang recalls with some wistfulness The goal of the institute was to mix physicists and computer scientists together and let them develop ideas that would eventually affect human life in a positive way These ideas included switching research gears if called to do so by your curiosity a feat Tang successfully completed in the late s after a sixmonth brain diet of literature and science meetings outside his discipline It was during that time I read Ken Dills paper on protein folding and it suddenly all sank in I wanted to work on biological problems
    - At UCSF he has done precisely that and if his quest ends successfully it might be rooted in the more holistic approach to problem solving in his native country which historically at least favors systematic insight over reductionism In Chinese philosophy we try to understand the whole to infer from the top down which is a good way to approach systems biology Chinese medicine doesnt have parts but eventually we hope to understand biological systems from their parts a case of East meets West

    paragraphs: 
    - Chao Tang
    - Scientists know a lot about the history of science Is that so surprising Perhaps not but when you think about it how many investment bankers know much about the history of money or politicians the history of government or car dealers the history of the automobile
    - Chao Tang PhD a professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences as well as a QB faculty affiliate understands the power of history very well Born in Chinas Jiangxi province and raised during the Cultural Revolution he grew up in a world where formal schooling was denigrated and most books banned It was a big disaster I didnt learn much he concedes Science books were an exception to the ban though and the young Tang took a particular shine to one roughly translated as the Whys
    - Tang has long since graduated from the Why is the sky blue chapter thanks in large part to the decision to reopen Chinese universities where he excelled But years after coming to the University of Chicago as part of a special physics program for Chinese scholars his curiosity and hunger for knowledge remain knifeedge sharp Now an acknowledged authority on the emerging field of systems biology broadly defined as the study of the collective behavior of individual interacting biological components Tang speaks with insight and obvious excitement about some of his heroes namely Johannes Kepler Tycho Brahe and Isaac Newton
    - Kepler Brahe and Newton What relevance could they possibly have to stcentury biological physics Simple Tang sees in their revolutionary astronomical discoveries about the orbits of planets and the universal laws of motion the same kind of cosmic explosion about to overtake biology

    - Chao Tang
    - Scientists know a lot about the history of science Is that so surprising Perhaps not but when you think about it how many investment bankers know much about the history of money or politicians the history of government or car dealers the history of the automobile
    - Chao Tang PhD a professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences as well as a QB faculty affiliate understands the power of history very well Born in Chinas Jiangxi province and raised during the Cultural Revolution he grew up in a world where formal schooling was denigrated and most books banned It was a big disaster I didnt learn much he concedes Science books were an exception to the ban though and the young Tang took a particular shine to one roughly translated as the Whys
    - Tang has long since graduated from the Why is the sky blue chapter thanks in large part to the decision to reopen Chinese universities where he excelled But years after coming to the University of Chicago as part of a special physics program for Chinese scholars his curiosity and hunger for knowledge remain knifeedge sharp Now an acknowledged authority on the emerging field of systems biology broadly defined as the study of the collective behavior of individual interacting biological components Tang speaks with insight and obvious excitement about some of his heroes namely Johannes Kepler Tycho Brahe and Isaac Newton
    - Kepler Brahe and Newton What relevance could they possibly have to stcentury biological physics Simple Tang sees in their revolutionary astronomical discoveries about the orbits of planets and the universal laws of motion the same kind of cosmic explosion about to overtake biology
    - In Keplers time there were lots and lots of data about the motions of stars and planets People tried to build models explaining the circular orbits of the planets says Tang Try as they might the imprecise data could only suggest that each planet had its own laws of motion
    - That changed when the Danishborn Tycho Brahes carefully calibrated instruments provided accurate measurements of planetary movements It was left to Kepler his German assistant and protg to unify all the data and postulate his three laws of planetary motion including his most famous Planets travel in elliptical orbits not circular ones
    - Newtons laws of motion and gravity came later and were brilliantly generalized extensions of what Kepler Brahe Galileo and others had discovered
    - So does Tang fancy himself a Kepler or a Newton The father of two is far too modest for that kind of selfcrowning Biology is in a similar stage as astronomy was in the s We have improved technology more and more data and better understanding of biological systems Im not sure if we will be able to develop a general Newtonianlike equation for cells But something big is about to happen and my dream is to be part of it
    - Some might argue that he already is Tang who holds two professorial appointments one at UCSF and the other at Peking University where he works several months per year enjoys precision He knows that in the vast array of interacting biological networks gene regulation systems would be one example neurons still another we are alive and well only because evolution has a similar taste for the exact Yet exact is not the same as rigid or fixed As structures individual neurons may be static but networks of neurons are anything but Or as Tang explains Biological systems have to be reliable and robust if they are to work correctly in a changing environment

    - Max Seibold
    - Does science take a holiday on the holidays Given the most recent studies Summary Full text Full text PDF that show more than half of Americans either reject evolution or hold equivocal views about its basic tenets we might wonder if science in America is headed for a permanent vacation
    - Factor in adult awareness of genetic concepts a pitiful score of on a point scale and the politicization of scientific principles at least in the US and its easy to sketch a sciencewillsoonbedead scenario
    - Would there be anyone in the forest to hear the tree fall
    - Its best to take a global perspective at these gloomy moments After all science continues to be cherished in most European and Asian countries
    - Still there are moments when one wonders if Americas antiscience disease is spreading The UKs University of Reading for example just announced that its physics department will close in The department it seems was losing money because not enough students were enrolled Indeed since the number of core science and math degrees offered by higher education institutions in the UK has dropped percent Chemistry and physics have been the hardest hit
    - Now I dont profess to understand the details of how higher education is financed in Britain But virtually every national and international economic forecasting report mentions the importance of scientific research to innovation and business development And if you have been reading previous installments of Science Caf you have learned how chemistry and physics are teaming up with biology to propel discovery at UCSF
    - Slighting one of the three seems shortsighted Still as a member of Parliament correctly pointed out the deeper problem is the failure to ignite an interest in science early on In short you need to create demand
    - Maybe what we need is a new growth industry a Science Corps patterned after the Peace Corps Young and old could scatter across school districts throughout the US run curiositybuilding programs in day care centers and other venues and recruit retired science teachers and scientists to develop and teach new curricula at no cost to the school districts or organizations The goal To eliminate ignorance which is every bit as important as battling disease
    - In the meantime those interested in actually seeing science and learning how experiments are conducted should take advantage of a new online window inside research laboratories This new video website named the Journal of Visualized Experiments consists entirely of videos of scientists performing basic molecular biology protocols The videos are not exactly arresting but they are real and in the desired public conversation about science reality should rule
    - Which leads me to the recent forum on science and religion at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla California As reported in The New York Times by George Johnson scientists of various stripes while disagreeing in tone and toughness agreed that science needs to take on an evangelical role vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told
    - Johnsons story crackles with memorable quotes and clever characterizations Consider this comment by Steven Weinberg Nobel laureate in physics Anything that we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization Or this by Oxfords Richard Dawkins evolutionary biologist and author of The God Delusion I am utterly fed up with the respect that we all of us including the secular among us are brainwashed into bestowing on religion
    - Whatever your views the article makes clear that the scientific counterattack against the antievolution forces gathered under the banner of intelligent design is heating up
    - A recent news item in Nature Was Life on Earth Inevitable may add fuel to the flame Written by Philip Ball and subtitled Life may be the ultimate in planetary stress relief the story discusses the theory of biologist Harold Morowitz of George Mason University and what else a physicist Eric Smith of New Mexicos Santa Fe Institute
    - They suggest that life on earth might have been inevitable because it was a necessary consequence of available energy built up by geological processes Or to put it another way the geological environment and its energyreleasing reactions forced life into existence and might do the same on any other sunny wet and rocky planets too
    - Whether or not this proves to be true the idea that an Earth with life is always more stable than one without despite several major extinctions is both comforting and aweinspiring Ball closes his story with a wonderful metaphor The researchers call this process a collapse to life which in their view is as inevitable as the appearance of snowflakes in cold moist air
    - That image alone should put an entirely different glow on this winter of discontent

    - Ken Dill
    - Chemical substances and the surfaces on which they operate have physical properties Otherwise for example how would proteins fold and then stay folded And when you think about it how does water the most ubiquitous of solvents really work at the biophysical level
    - These kinds of questions keep protein expert Ken Dill associate dean for research in the UCSF School of Pharmacy energized But it is Americas turn away from scientific innovation and the free ranging inquiry that underpins discovery that keeps him exercised
    - Weve gone from an era of deep innovation to one of incremental advances Dill decries
    - But how can this be The National Institutes of Health NIH the grant making giant of biomedicine now has a US billion annual budget Surely all this money is being used to fund something more than incremental advances
    - Yes its true There is still great science What is lacking is truly deep innovation Dill says with some sadness To be fair he continues the NIH occasionally funds a bluesky leap but the very size of its budget puts a premium on immediate accountability And immediacy is the enemy of real bitethebullet dreambig science
    - Dill does not blame the NIH leadership Big budgets mean big expectations And be patient is not a message US congressional oversight committees and taxpayers want to hear Their questions are always bottom line questions like Wheres the payoff What new diseases have you cured today
    - The result says Dill is a ferociously competitive atmosphere where to reviewers at NIH sit in a room passing judgment on grant proposals one at a time And the review process itself is often a collective search for flaws in proposals not a vital pursuit to find something new
    - Given the pressure its not surprising says Dill that grant proposals now succeed based on their predictability on the overwhelming preliminary evidence that the project wont fail not on their innovation What has made the NIH so risk averse Its mainly the mechanism not the reviewers says Dill Essentially all of the NIHs one hundred review panels have the same problem
    - The affable and loquacious Dill is not a verbal bombthrower exploding into a rage at a once fruitful system gone bad If anything his is a parental voice of concern full of disappointment
    - And like a concerned parent he wants to fix the problem So over the last eight years he has become a national advocate for reform A past president of the Biophysical Society which recently named him its Distinguished Service Award winner Dill is cochair of the societys public affairs committee He also is cofounder of the Bridging the Sciences Coalition which brings together science societies to speak as one voice for deeper innovation and crossdisciplinary research In this role Dill makes on average six trips to Washington DC each year to meet with fellow scientists US Congress members and staffers and administration officials His message innovation sparks advances in knowledge and advances create competitiveness
    - Still one could wonder why Dill a respected UCSF scientist for decades would make such a fuss Dill pauses sighs and then smiles Scientists understand that they are part of long chain of theorists and experimentalists that stretch back to the ancient Greeks At some point in their career some scientists and he counts himself in their number realize that they want to contribute to the longterm health of the discipline They become troubleshooters and advocates illuminating stress points in the system with a mix of futurism history and anthropology
    - In keeping with that spirit when Dill describes his youthful excitement about science in the s and s he is speaking yes about the putthemanonthemoon applied variety but also about the growing network of laboratories and think tanks that made curiosity fundable and the serendipitous sexy
    - Harry Truman and JFK had a new vision of science We need that king of big thinking again What Dill sees instead are oversightdriven research funding the demise of such industrial research facilities as Bell Laboratories and a giant funding hole between the biomedical imperative of NIH and the hard physics directive of the National Science Foundation
    - My field of biophysics is wellfunded But you cant get research funded at the moment for the deep physics which might have a payoff for biology Its trapped between the two agencies
    - That fact according to Dill has created an ironic reversal of fortune literally It used to be that academic scientists were accused of living in an ivory tower of sitting around in laboratories taking federal dollars and doing things that were never going to pay off Some did pay off in a very big way of course Think new drugs semiconductors computers telecommunications lasers liquidcrystal displays and the Internet to name only some examples
    - Dill hasnt heard the term ivory tower though in a decade or two and he knows why There is huge pressure on academic scientists not to be in the ivory tower anymore so now if we have a super blue sky idea the only way to get that funded is to go to venture capitalists I find that both interesting and sad
    - Part Next time Dill gets specific about how we can reignite the spirit of scientific innovation He also describes his own favorite bluesky project Are you ready to explore a prebiotic world

    title: "Stopping Parkinson&rsquo;s: A Conversation with Rob Edwards, Physician-Scientist"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Robert Edwards
    - Translational science is a hugely popular term these days in part because it captures both the promise and the accountability of biomedical research A generation ago the favored term was bench to bedside And in the intervening years breakthrough science and high tech to high touch each had their day in the sun
    - Robert Edwards MD prefers the oldfashioned term diseaserelated research but not because he is nostalgic In his mind it best explains what he does and who he is that increasingly rare hybrid known as a physicianscientist
    - There are not too many of us around at UCSF and after you consider other academic research centers like Harvard and Johns Hopkins there are few places that have any at all says Edwards
    - So what exactly is a physicianscientist and what is it about the career choice that keeps their numbers so small
    - As to the first question the best and shortest answer is anyone with a MD or MDPhD degree who undertakes basic biomedical research
    - And as to what explains their small numbers there are now only about MDs doing basic science research in the United States cultural reasons often surface Physicianscientists must be able to defend against the neithernor prejudice which hints that their double major has made them neither this nor that They must also constantly maintain their credentials with colleagues on both sides of the researchpatient care aisle a test that can grow wearisome
    - And then there are the grueling years of work To qualify as an MDPhD for example recently minted MDs defer their clinical training and instead detour into a research laboratory to study the building blocks of disease as it arises within and among cells a process that coupled with the clinical rotations completed after their doctoral dissertation can sometimes take seven eight or even nine years
    - Some clinical researchers skip the PhD part of the equation and devote themselves to patientoriented research right out of the box a decision that places them in or around clinics where the patients are Recent estimates put their numbers at about
    - Edwards a neurologist who both heads up a research laboratory at UCSF Mission Bay and regularly sees patients believes there is a single characteristic that unites all the variants
    - People like me like to bang away at one problem Not everyone does You really have to want to have the answer to a problem he says
    - Edwards particular problem is the neurodegenerative disease known as Parkinsons which afflicts an estimated million Americans
    - What causes Parkinsons Rob Edwards explains
    - Edwards came to Parkinsons through a back door of sorts A UCSF neurology resident between and Edwards did his postdoctoral work in the lab of the legendary William Rutter PhD where he studied nerve growth factor
    - What ultimately captivated him though was what happens at synapses the junctions on a nerve cell where nerve cells communicate This led him to the chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters and their elegant releaseandrespond transformation from electrical impulse to chemical reaction and back again
    - All the interesting stuff occurs at synapses Edwards exults Its where information is processed where memories form where all cognition is based
    - It was while still a postdoctoral fellow in the mids that Edwards first learned of a group of young intravenous drug users in nearby Santa Clara County The drug users were distinctive because they were developing Parkinsonslike muscle tremors and weakness the result of poisoning by a byproduct of heroin manufacture known as MPTP MPTP kills neurons particularly those responsible for producing dopamine a chemical that influences muscle control
    - Why was that important Parkinsons disease starts when the brain cells that produce dopamine begin to die What these unfortunate drug users had done Edwards explains is to turn themselves into human experiments By studying what makes MPTP toxic Edwards and his colleagues ultimately found a gene that protects against it How so The transporter would sequester the toxin inside the vesicles where it couldnt do any damage to the host cell We used a clinical observation to understand the science says Edwards
    - Which is wonderful news except that dont we give those with earlystage Parkinsons a dopamine replacement drug known as Ldopa And based on Edwards work with MPTP is dopamine then a toxin too
    - Yes and yes are the answers Edwards explains Dopamine is an internal toxin but evolution has equipped us with protective measures that enable its benefits without causing serious consequences Ldopa does slow the progression of Parkinsons for five to years which is why we prescribe it Edwards adds But there are some who wonder if the drug might be making the underlying disease worse
    - Learn more about Rob Edwards Parkinsons disease research
    - Finding answers to the Parkinsons riddle will take time Edwards insists knowing the frustration of patients who bristle at the slow pace of progress He has high hopes that work on the nerve terminal protein known as synuclein discovered by recent UCSF recruit Robert Nussbaum MD will speed things along
    - Nussbaum has noted that synuclein accumulates in large amounts in the brains of nearly everyone with Parkinsons disease Synculein also hangs out at the synapses the same part of the cell implicated in Edwards other work on neurotransmitter release And that could be a good thing since Edwards can now use his experience from basic research on the synapse to help understand Parkinsons disease
    - In the meantime Edwards will continue to teach see patients and keep trying to understand how a brain goes wrong and stays right He doesnt expect any special thanks He just loves what hes doing

    title: "Live Long and Prosper: A Conversation About Aging with Cynthia Kenyon"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Cynthia Kenyon
    - Cynthia Kenyon PhD director of the UCSFs Larry L Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging smiles a lot these days And with good reason She has aging cornered and she knows it In less than years her oncecrazy idea that genes regulate aging has not only gone mainstream but spawned a huge field of research with giant conclaves and dozens of journal articles published every year
    - It wasnt always this way of course Like many young scientists with a novel idea Kenyon encountered more skepticism than support in the early s Indeed one fellow scientist worried that she had gone over the edge warned that if she continued to insist that aging was subject to genetic regulation she would soon fall off the Earth altogether But her world turned out to be round not flat And now firmly anchored as if not exactly the queen of aging research then certainly its ace Kenyon commands no fewer than entries on a standard Google search
    - It didnt matter that most people thought I was nuts says Kenyon in breathless staccato I was dead set on studying this because I was convinced that there was something there Why else she explains would mice live two years rats three years squirrels and bats If there were genes that regulated the rate of aging then you would expect that evolution could change life span by changing regulatory genes she states with certitude
    - The kernel of her revolutionary suspicion was that life span and aging were too important to be left to chance completely Proving it particularly in her animal model the lowly roundworm known as C elegans required both pluck and luck It also helped that she was at UCSF UCSF is a place where nonconformity is valued
    - The story is now wellknown One of Kenyons lab rotation students Ramon Tabtiang in one of his very first experiments picked a needle out of the haystack that is the C elegans genome In short he found a mutant gene dubbed daf that made worms live twice as long C elegans was and is a favorite model for developmental biologists and geneticists because its simple structure and entire threeweek life are easily scrutinized under the microscope
    - Watching the mutant worms says Kenyon was like witnessing a miracle Not only did these worms live longer they retained good muscle tone squirmed sought food and stayed youthful In comparison normal or wild worms of the same twoweek age were flabby tattered and sedentary They looked old The message was clear The rate of aging was not fixed in stone after all It could be slowed
    - In the years since Kenyon and her team have made more eyepopping discoveries including the role of a companion gene called daf that controls on or off signals in still other genes Learning more about the insulin pathway in which these genes operate helped her to understand a cascade of signals and responses as they reverberate through individual tissues
    - Better yet by using this information to tweak here and there in the worm genome Kenyon and her laboratory colleagues have been able to extend a worms life up to six times the normal span with no significant decline in vitality until late in life They did this by altering cells in the reproductive system which controls life span as well as by changing daf The sixtimeslongerlived worms dont reproduce unlike the daf mutants which live twice as long as normal and can be fully fertile
    - Researchers have since confirmed that similar genes and pathways work in approximately the same way in both fruit flies and mice
    - But what does that say about humans Has Kenyon found the secret to immortality From all the hype that sometimes surrounds her work you might think so Kenyon herself makes no such claim She is enthusiastic yes She is persuasive definitely She is provocative occasionally But she is also careful There is still much to learn about all the twists and turns in the genetic landscape that influences human life span
    - That said some truths have emerged particularly about the role of the insulin pathway which clearly plays a role in how fast an animal ages Indeed the many websites and publications promoting longevity often call insulin the death hormone Some adopt a more positive slogan Eat less live more Still others tout the more scientificsounding term caloric restriction
    - Call it what you will the basic message is the same By eating fewer carbohydrates you can provoke a bit of a theresashortageoffood response inside your body Kenyon suggests a possible explanation supported by her studies When you dont have enough insulin your body senses danger and mounts a response Protective mechanisms are mobilized Antioxidants are produced Chaperone proteins that help other proteins fold correctly become resistant to infections Your immune response is strengthened
    - But how much restriction is good for us And what does Kenyon herself do in her own life In the next edition of Science Caf we tackle these and other questions including whether aging is really a disease and what happens if we all start living to be years old

    title: "Chile Warms to UCSF Science: A Conversation with Graduate Student Monica Rodrigo-Brenni"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Monica RodrigoBrenni
    - Monica RodrigoBrenni loves science especially those moments when after tagging proteins she destroys them Its not as violent as it sounds Proteins have power but they dont have feelings And tracking what happens inside a cell when certain proteins are out of the mix is standard stuff in laboratories around the world
    - That world includes the laboratory of UCSF cell biologist David Morgan PhD where RodrigoBrenni is a fourthyear graduate student researching the secrets of cell cycle control She is very happy to be there I like the fact that here at UCSF the top scientists and the graduate students are more like colleagues she says I feel OK going up to any professor and asking them a question
    - Questions are currency in her world They signal an eager mind one that enjoys discovery one that yearns for it
    - But to what end you might ask
    - RodrigoBrenni doesnt hesitate before answering I want to be a principal investigator someday have my own lab study cell biology teach do the whole academic thing She pauses then laughs I dont like working on whole organisms so much although when I was growing up I always liked playing with bugs I still do
    - Curiosity of course marks every scientist For some like RodrigoBrenni it also makes them Orphaned as a teenager in Chile she came to nearby Albany California to live with relatives and finish high school She then attended Diablo Valley Community College before transferring to UC Davis where she majored in biochemistry I loved my chemistry classes at community college But since I also loved biology I decided to put the two together
    - RodrigoBrenni uses the word love a lot It reflects her enthusiasm for the world of wonder that she has had the good fortune and the drive to study Its no surprise then that as this National Science Foundation Fellow ponders her postdoc career I might study virology viruses have such neat ways to coopt cells and get them to do what they want she also wants to share her love of science with others
    - And UCSFs Science Health Education Partnership SEP makes that easy to do Founded in and housed in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics SEP is a collaboration between UCSF scientists and the San Francisco Unified School District Its goal to bring both scientists and educators together in the classroom to support quality education for K students
    - RodrigoBrenni an experienced tutor was an eager recruit Being bilingual also made her the logical choice to help teach four classes on cells and systems to fourth and fifthgraders in one of San Franciscos bilingual elementary schools While the science classes happened to be taught in English during her stint many of the students were more proficient in Spanish Sometimes I needed to explain concepts in Spanish onetoone with students she explains
    - The session on respiration which required that students build their own models of lungs learning about air exchange and diffusion in the process closed with a bang RodrigoBrenni and her UCSF colleague Chantilly Munson brought actual lung specimens to the classroom both healthy and diseased and let the students both see and touch them The smokers lung left an impression that needed no translation The kids said Boy Im going to exercise now she recalls with a smile
    - Other sessions on the cardiac system and yeast we showed how if you feed yeast cells a sugary substance they produce carbon dioxide were also big hits But the biggest thrill says RodrigoBrenni was knowing that she had penetrated the brain matter of fifthgraders We had to explain fairly complex topics and when they then asked us insightful questions that were right on the money we knew that they had understood and could carry on with the knowledge themselves That was the best part They were excited about the science
    - But is it possible to duplicate that success elsewhere in another country perhaps How about Chile Chile you ask Why there
    - True RodrigoBrenni was born in South America but that would be a plus not a cause The real reason stems from the life and work of famed Chilean scientist Pablo Valenzuela PhD Valenzuela trained as a postdoc in the UCSF lab of William Rutter PhD in the s After cofounding Chiron with Rutter in he served as its research director overseeing the development of the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine the sequencing of the AIDS virus and the discovery of the hepatitis C virus With Chiron successful and growing Valenzuela ultimately went home to found a nonprofit organization Fundacin Ciencia para la Vida and a biotechnology company Bios Chile which has had its own string of successes
    - He did not forget about his UCSF experience though and as he pondered ways for building bridges to American universities Valenzuela found a human connection in UCSF biochemistry and biophysics graduate student Sebastin Bernales Bernales was raised in Chile where he attended Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile before moving to the United States to work at Chiron and eventually enrolling in the UCSF Tetrad Program He now works in the laboratory of Peter Walter PhD
    - Bernales knows RodrigoBrenni and on a second trip to Chile in fall the first took place in RodrigoBrenni joined a group of fellow UCSF graduate students and three members of the UCSF faculty Regis Kelly PhD Marc Shuman MD and Joe DeRisi PhD for a scientific exchange program that included an SEP module at a school in one of Santiagos poorer neighborhoods The teaching session which followed last years discussion of science outreach to disadvantaged schools was sponsored by Bernardita Mndez PhD at Fundacin Ciencia para la Vida and by the InquiryBased Science Education Program of Chiles Ministry of Education It was also supported by Patricia Caldera PhD SEPs academic coordinator
    - Despite the distance between San Francisco and Santiago the eighthgrade Chilean students were equally revved about the science experiments This time around RodrigoBrenni and six other UCSF students showed them how to extract DNA from strawberries strawberries have millions of cells using simple tools from dish soap to coffee filters The students in Santiago were a little more afraid to ask questions at the start I dont think the class was inquirybased
    - RodrigoBrenni soon won them over I kept asking them for feedback and somebody raised their hand and then other people starting asking questions Everyone got into it in the end
    - Proving once again that science has no boundaries and that love for what you do has no substitute

    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Monica RodrigoBrenni
    - Monica RodrigoBrenni loves science especially those moments when after tagging proteins she destroys them Its not as violent as it sounds Proteins have power but they dont have feelings And tracking what happens inside a cell when certain proteins are out of the mix is standard stuff in laboratories around the world
    - That world includes the laboratory of UCSF cell biologist David Morgan PhD where RodrigoBrenni is a fourthyear graduate student researching the secrets of cell cycle control She is very happy to be there I like the fact that here at UCSF the top scientists and the graduate students are more like colleagues she says I feel OK going up to any professor and asking them a question
    - Questions are currency in her world They signal an eager mind one that enjoys discovery one that yearns for it
    - But to what end you might ask
    - RodrigoBrenni doesnt hesitate before answering I want to be a principal investigator someday have my own lab study cell biology teach do the whole academic thing She pauses then laughs I dont like working on whole organisms so much although when I was growing up I always liked playing with bugs I still do
    - Curiosity of course marks every scientist For some like RodrigoBrenni it also makes them Orphaned as a teenager in Chile she came to nearby Albany California to live with relatives and finish high school She then attended Diablo Valley Community College before transferring to UC Davis where she majored in biochemistry I loved my chemistry classes at community college But since I also loved biology I decided to put the two together
    - RodrigoBrenni uses the word love a lot It reflects her enthusiasm for the world of wonder that she has had the good fortune and the drive to study Its no surprise then that as this National Science Foundation Fellow ponders her postdoc career I might study virology viruses have such neat ways to coopt cells and get them to do what they want she also wants to share her love of science with others
    - And UCSFs Science Health Education Partnership SEP makes that easy to do Founded in and housed in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics SEP is a collaboration between UCSF scientists and the San Francisco Unified School District Its goal to bring both scientists and educators together in the classroom to support quality education for K students
    - RodrigoBrenni an experienced tutor was an eager recruit Being bilingual also made her the logical choice to help teach four classes on cells and systems to fourth and fifthgraders in one of San Franciscos bilingual elementary schools While the science classes happened to be taught in English during her stint many of the students were more proficient in Spanish Sometimes I needed to explain concepts in Spanish onetoone with students she explains
    - The session on respiration which required that students build their own models of lungs learning about air exchange and diffusion in the process closed with a bang RodrigoBrenni and her UCSF colleague Chantilly Munson brought actual lung specimens to the classroom both healthy and diseased and let the students both see and touch them The smokers lung left an impression that needed no translation The kids said Boy Im going to exercise now she recalls with a smile
    - Other sessions on the cardiac system and yeast we showed how if you feed yeast cells a sugary substance they produce carbon dioxide were also big hits But the biggest thrill says RodrigoBrenni was knowing that she had penetrated the brain matter of fifthgraders We had to explain fairly complex topics and when they then asked us insightful questions that were right on the money we knew that they had understood and could carry on with the knowledge themselves That was the best part They were excited about the science
    - But is it possible to duplicate that success elsewhere in another country perhaps How about Chile Chile you ask Why there
    - True RodrigoBrenni was born in South America but that would be a plus not a cause The real reason stems from the life and work of famed Chilean scientist Pablo Valenzuela PhD Valenzuela trained as a postdoc in the UCSF lab of William Rutter PhD in the s After cofounding Chiron with Rutter in he served as its research director overseeing the development of the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine the sequencing of the AIDS virus and the discovery of the hepatitis C virus With Chiron successful and growing Valenzuela ultimately went home to found a nonprofit organization Fundacin Ciencia para la Vida and a biotechnology company Bios Chile which has had its own string of successes
    - He did not forget about his UCSF experience though and as he pondered ways for building bridges to American universities Valenzuela found a human connection in UCSF biochemistry and biophysics graduate student Sebastin Bernales Bernales was raised in Chile where he attended Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile before moving to the United States to work at Chiron and eventually enrolling in the UCSF Tetrad Program He now works in the laboratory of Peter Walter PhD
    - Bernales knows RodrigoBrenni and on a second trip to Chile in fall the first took place in RodrigoBrenni joined a group of fellow UCSF graduate students and three members of the UCSF faculty Regis Kelly PhD Marc Shuman MD and Joe DeRisi PhD for a scientific exchange program that included an SEP module at a school in one of Santiagos poorer neighborhoods The teaching session which followed last years discussion of science outreach to disadvantaged schools was sponsored by Bernardita Mndez PhD at Fundacin Ciencia para la Vida and by the InquiryBased Science Education Program of Chiles Ministry of Education It was also supported by Patricia Caldera PhD SEPs academic coordinator
    - Despite the distance between San Francisco and Santiago the eighthgrade Chilean students were equally revved about the science experiments This time around RodrigoBrenni and six other UCSF students showed them how to extract DNA from strawberries strawberries have millions of cells using simple tools from dish soap to coffee filters The students in Santiago were a little more afraid to ask questions at the start I dont think the class was inquirybased
    - RodrigoBrenni soon won them over I kept asking them for feedback and somebody raised their hand and then other people starting asking questions Everyone got into it in the end
    - Proving once again that science has no boundaries and that love for what you do has no substitute

    title: Bring Back the Ivory Tower, Part 2 of 2
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Ken Dill
    - In the first installment of Bring Back the Ivory Tower UCSF biophysicist and School of Pharmacy protein expert Ken Dill spelled out the dismal state today of deep innovation in academic science He also decried the funding hole that divides biomedicine which is represented by the National Institutes of Health NIH and physical science research which is championed by the National Science Foundation NSF
    - As a result Dill continues much of the grantfunded science has become incremental and predictable The NIH is a missiondriven agency says Dill Its mission is to support biomedical research that will pay off for the public The NSF on the other hand is a disciplinedriven agency It functions by research fields such as chemistry and mathematics
    - The paradox argues Dill is that new discoveries need both perspectives Or to steal a lyric from singersongwriter Tracy Chapman There is truth in the space between
    - And lets not forget there is also mystery Perhaps that explains Dills interest in prebiotic evolution and one of the biggest ivorytower scientific questions of all How did life on earth begin
    - Many molecular evolutionists now believe that before DNA became the top dog RNA ran the show RNA can encode and catalyze after all and its continuing role as DNA messenger and presumed role as gene regulator speak to its enduring importance in living creatures
    - As impressed as he is with the RNA world though Dill still has doubts and in his big bluesky moments he wonders whether something else came first maybe a metabolism world essentially a giant chemistry experiment occurring naturally and spontaneously
    - When you think about RNA its a pretty complicated feature to leap onto the scene in full flower and ready to start propagating There had to be something that the RNA world wanted to propagate forward in the first place
    - But how would a metabolismfirst world work How would the chemicals organize themselves in one way or another And how would you test for answers
    - We have an idea how this might happen It has to do with enzymes Weve just submitted a paper that presents our ideas says Dill Implicit in these ideas is a daring model that will shape the experiments that could prove or disprove his premise Modelers like me are supposed to be bold to make predictions that people arent expecting to ask questions that experimentalists arent already asking
    - Lets pause a moment to think about what Dill is saying Before Einstein for example Nobel Prizes in physics were all given to experimentalists Theoretical modeling became prominent in physics only after it started making accurate predictions of things that were not already pretty obvious in the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics for example
    - Dill believes biology needs a similar shot in the arm a theoretical boost of the first magnitude And to make that leap scientists need to get off the treadmill step out of the stream dream a little again At this moment in biology theory usually follows experiments rather than preceding them
    - So what is the solution One possibility is higherrisk grants In short proposals would be short a page or two not singlespaced pages long Moreover approvals would be based on the passion persistence and track record of the scientist and on the proposals novelty not its predictability Risky Yes and definitely not for everyone
    - If you look at any economics book about investments youre always told to put a little into highrisk investments Thats all were saying about grants Lets put to percent into highrisk stuff For Dill scientists are the stuff Put smart scientists in a room let them think and great ideas can surface Its just like Google Dill adds Google employees are encouraged to play for percent of their workday because thats when inspiration comes
    - And new ideas are urgently needed if America is to retain its scientific preeminence and all the economic vitality that comes along with it We used to get the worlds best students studying in US labs But theres a lot more competition now Dill explains Indeed India China Singapore and a resurgent Europe are beginning to capture the fancy of the brightest students as well as prime their own student pipelines with rigorous educational standards These other countries are making longterm investments in people and facilities China is building dozens of new research universities Singapore already has Biopolis a life sciences city and thought center and is making plans for a comparable computer science center too
    - American students could fill the gaps of course yet Dill worries that too few of them think of science and mathematics as worthy careers I wish more American parents would help their kids understand the importance of these subjects In other countries many parents and kids see science as the future Theres no comparable national vision here
    - There is growing political awareness however Dill happily reports In fact Dill together with representatives in a member coalition of science societies has found bipartisan support for what might be called our innovation infrastructure The various elements of and the reasons for the plan many of which have been discussed in Science Caf have been packaged into something called the American Competitiveness Initiative which commits US billion in fiscal year to increase investments in research and development strengthen education and encourage entrepreneurship
    - What happens next on Capitol Hill is unclear What happens next in Dills UCSF lab is completely transparent At a time when basic science has become a bottom line business Dill when not on the road will be retreating to his ivory tower for some serious playtime with ideas He hopes that everyone else in academic science will soon be doing the same

    title: Is Aging a Disease? A Conversation with Cynthia Kenyon
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Cynthia Kenyon
    - For the first part of this conversation see Live Long and Prosper A Conversation About Aging with Cynthia Kenyon
    - For someone who has become the darling of antiaging research advocates UCSFs Cynthia Kenyon PhD is remarkably conservative about her personal dietary regimen I eat a lowcarb diet because weve shown that keeping insulin levels low is good for animals and were animals
    - Kenyon also exercises moderately drinks a glass or two of red wine every day sips green tea and ingests a baby aspirin daily The baby aspirin is good for heart attacks and maybe cancer says the yearold director of the Larry L Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging She also recommends staying out of direct sunlight to offset the appearance of aging
    - None of these measures triggers immortality of course But even a cursory review of longevity and diet websites suggests that hucksterism and selfdeception remain as timeless as ever The most sinister notion now making its way through cyberspace is that food is an enemy a curious flip side to the developed worlds obesity epidemic and one that allows adherents of extreme caloric restriction to mask nearanorexia as healthful living
    - Like all responsible scientists who work close to the boundaries of popular culture Kenyon worries that nuance gets lost in translation I think a highcarb diet which gives you a lot of insulin is not good for you she explains But I dont think insulin and insulin growth factor are evil We need them to grow and to process our food
    - The key message here is balance Kenyons research has shown that if you go too far in genetically modifying the insulin pathway the increase in life span stops Knock out the gene entirely and the animal dies Intermediate steps if not carefully calibrated could in theory at least trigger a disease Kenyon is well aware of the pitfalls and because she is has not fallen prey to them
    - Whats really interesting Kenyon enthuses is that you can get the life span benefits by taking away the insulin receptor in individual tissues So it might not be overall percentage of insulin function we need to concentrate on but a selective percentage in different tissues like fat cells for example
    - Is a pill to slow aging in the works then Not right away although Kenyons company Elixir Pharmaceuticals is developing drugs that target metabolic disease and who knows maybe aging as well by reducing insulin levels and increasing the cells sensitivity to insulin something that goes awry in type diabetes
    - You would think that with all this talk and all this ink Kenyon would rarely encounter skeptics anymore But take it from her She does all the time Some people say to me Well aging is a disease isnt it so youre really talking about treating a medical condition I think theyre having fun with words because by definition a disease is something physical that happens to some but not all
    - Progeria for example is considered a disease because the rapid aging it causes does not affect everyone If progeria or Alzheimers happened to everyone these conditions would not be called a disease They would simply be considered aging Living to be is another example Are those who fail to reach triple digits diseased by comparison How about not being able to run as fast when youre older Is running more slowly a disease
    - We dont bother calling these things a disease because they are part of an uneven process that we accept if sometimes disregard or abhor Perhaps that is why Kenyon constantly confronts pessimism Pessimism is a natural defense against the kind of disappointments aging makes commonplace A lot of people still think that when you make worms live six times longer its a cocktail trick something thats interesting and fun but not a reality or a possibility
    - Kenyons response is characteristically rich substantive and upbeat There are good reasons why we now live as long as we do she says From a cultural perspective improvements in public health more and better drugs such as antibiotics and the fruits of an organized society to name just a few offer protection a food supply opportunity and general wellbeing whatever societys obvious shortcomings
    - So its not unreasonable she says for people to assume that weve reached our magical limit which averages years for American men born today and years for women give or take the impact of genes lifestyle and good fortune
    - But I dont see why that has to be our natural age limit she continues Think of it this way There are long and shortlived insects birds and mammals During evolution there must have been a first insect a first bird a first mammal and probably all of them had a short life span Evolution has shown that aging well is evolvable Its not like life span changed just once and thats it It can happen again
    - What happens if shes right and like the worms in her lab we learn how to stay youthful and fit well past and then sometime around years old crash and die quickly Wouldnt society as we know it crash even sooner under the weight of a new gerontocracy
    - Society would adapt Kenyon proclaims with typical enthusiasm Weve already changed things It used to be that very few people made it to age Now most people do The birthrate would also have to come down and that is happening now too although you wouldnt want it to come down too far because the world needs young people
    - Plus she adds were not talking about a civilization in which walkers replace sports cars as a symbol of youth Instead the rate of aging would slow so that a yearold would look and feel like a yearold And Kenyon adds who wouldnt love that kind of energy experience and vitality pulsing through society
    - Her smile fades for a moment She becomes thoughtful Maybe universities wouldnt like it she offers upon reflection You couldnt get tenure at and then stay on faculty for years That would never happen

    - Volker Doetsch
    - In the first installment of my conversation with Volker Doetsch director of Goethe Universitys Institute of Biophysical Chemistry in Frankfurt Germany Doetsch made two important points First science works best when its international Second the conduct and style of German science are changing dramatically
    - Doetsch who continues as an adjunct professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacys Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry is helping to make that change happen I like to create an interesting research environment I want more professors around me but I want them to be independent of me for ideas and input
    - This is a very American very UCSF kind of attitude and one that thrives best with nostringsattached financial support increasingly rare in the United States Imagine then a UCSFstyle laboratory full of smart and energetic young people led by someone who does not have to worry about money for infrastructure or fulltime employees and you get some idea of what Doetsch is creating in Frankfurt
    - With machines at his disposal he now has one of the largest university NMR facilities in the world Why
    - This leads to the third significant point
    - At UCSF for example principal investigators receive a salary and a portion of their grant usually from the NIH and nothing else Doetsch explains In Germany by contrast Doetsch receives a salary an administrative assistant three postdoc positions two technicians and euros approximately to do whatever I want with it
    - The NMR machines are paid for and maintained by the university Considering that Doetsch and his team are investigating the conformation and dynamics of proteins inside living cells and are developing protein profiles that could help determine how potential drug molecules could cross the cellular membrane and interact with their targets more and bigger machines are key And if not all wishes are granted the renewed national appreciation of science means that many of them are This creates conditions that benefit discovery Or as Doetsch says Since I dont have to worry where the money is coming from and how long it will last we can really focus on the science
    - Doetschs lab can also sponsor more projects One in particular has already borne fruit It involves a novel cellfree membrane protein expression system It is very difficult to get milligram amounts of proteins in any other way he says As a result his lab is now close to determining the structure of one of these membrane proteins and is training others including students from UCSF in how the extraction system works
    - As current German Chancellor Angela Merkel a physicist by training states in the Science magazine editorial Our benchmarks are excellence internationality and freedom By we aim to increase spending on RD to percent of gross domestic product Already the German government has set aside billion euros to fund innovative beacon projects and under Merkel has stated that the task of government is to create conditions in which science and research can flourish In short Germany is developing a national science policy that over time could keep many of its best scientists home
    - Speaking of scientists consider this German science students begin to specialize as soon as they finish the equivalent of high school which has recently been shortened to years from to ensure that German scientists are younger than they currently are when they finish their PhD degree German males also have nine months of mandatory army service Does the specialization lead to any significant advantages
    - This is the fourth significant point
    - Doetsch is careful not to compare the merits of American and German students but the differences in their training do contribute to a difference in perspective and in the long run perhaps to a longer scientific career for the latter And it is this mix of ideas styles and insights that he argues makes the movement of scientists across borders and their mingling in different laboratories an important part of the discovery process It also cements collaborations which are the antithesis of research silos that arise on both sides of the Atlantic
    - Indeed at Goethe University the students caught up in the spirit of the collaborative age and chafing at the traditional department and institute boundaries have organized a Night of Sciences
    - All the professors here had to give short talks on their work and it went on all night long They even had candles lighting the pathways Doetsch recalls
    - Candles might not be right for UCSF too much wind and fog But it is always wise to be reminded that in this new and flatter world where excellence is defined in global terms science achievement and the number of international students and scholars who come here because of it has made UCSF a world university not just a San Francisco one Lets hope the illumination continues

    title: "Front Row Seat on a Hidden Universe: A Conversation with Torsten Wittmann"

    paragraphs: 
    - Torsten Wittmann
    - You have to love cells They are such wonders of economical packaging All of our genetic material is housed inside them And they are literally bursting with biochemical activity as proteins assemble and go about their lifegiving work
    - Did I mention that they also find time to divide and multiply some more readily than others that humans have trillions of them specialized into more than different types nerve muscle heart to name but a few or that they vary in size from to microns Sorry guys sperm cells are the smallest of all
    - Given their central importance to life itself it should come as no surprise then that there are scientists who want nothing more than to see inside cells and explore among other possibilities the mechanism by which cells regulate their shape and behavior Germanborn Torsten Wittmann PhD certainly does And as one of the newest faculty members in the UCSF School of Dentistrys Department of Cell and Tissue Biology he has a front row seat on this hidden universe
    - Mitotic spindles assembled in vitro in Xenopus egg extract showing microtubules red chromosomes blue and TPX a protein that is enriched at spindle poles green See larger
    - Cells are amazingly beautiful It fascinates me just to look at them says Wittmann who once studied mitotic spindle assembly at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg Germany His fascination has grown with improvements in technology Digital imaging has changed everything in the last years or so says Wittmann recently relocated from the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla California
    - To understand why the cell biology field has changed we first need to understand a technique known as fluorescence microscopy In short it is possible to attach fluorescent probes to different components inside a cell which will then light up under a very powerful light microscope The beauty of the images apart from their resemblance to star clusters or nebulae is their specificity
    - Mouse fibroblasts stained for actin blue microtubules yellow and nuclei green Image won first place at the Nikon Small World contest See larger
    - Fluoresence microscopy enables us to see specific structures or proteins inside a cell Wittmann explains and the recent discovery of proteins that are fluorescent themselves allows us to observe the dynamics of specific proteins in living cells
    - For a time the downside of this technique was the difficulty in getting good images With standard film cameras one would sometimes take three rolls of film and not get pictures that were any good Wittmann recalls
    - Fluorescent tubulin yellow overlaid over a differential interference contrast image of a live migrating kangaroo kidney epithelial cell The cell is expressing an activated signaling protein which gives it a flat fried egglike shape See larger
    - Not anymore Using highquality digital cameras that were actually first developed for astronomy more powerful lenses and confocal techniques to eliminate outoffocus light the light microscope has become in essence a digital device shooting many frames per second and capturing cellular events in striking detail Digital images also allow sophisticated computerized image analysis
    - A key difference too apart from the price tag for the most advanced microscope setups is that the cells being studied can now be living ones not dead and fixed to a slide We can now quantify what is happening with different proteins and make conclusions about how certain processes in the cell are regulated in space and time and what the functions of specific proteins are on a subcellular level Wittmann explains
    - Migrating goldfish skin keratocytes stained for actin blue and adhesion sites red These cells that form the epithelium underneath fish scales are the fastest migrating vertebrate cells See larger
    - Why is this important We know that cells serve as a factory for many of the ingredients that sustain life and that these ingredients need to move from one location to another Consider what happens to chromosomes for example as they are segregated correctly and moved into proper position prior to cell division This is movement on a grand and precise scale Indeed without proper cell division embryos die And if the process were to stop in adults many of our major organs would quickly shut down taking us with them But whats behind all this movement
    - UCSFs Ron Vale PhD has been a pioneer in answering that question with his work on motor proteins Motor proteins need the cells version of a roadway to get where theyre going Thats where Wittmann comes in He studies microtubules hollow protein rods that give shape and structure to a cell and that also shrink and grow in a random fashion a nonequilibrium process discovered in the early s at UCSF by Tim Mitchison PhD and Marc Kirschner PhD Motor proteins move along microtubules to generate the force required to move chromosomes for example
    - Dividing kangaroo epithelial cell Microtubules green DNA blue EB a protein that specifically associates with growing microtubule ends yellow See larger
    - In watching the elaborate dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton Wittmann has become fascinated with a group of proteins that in cells only bind to growing ends of microtubules They look like little comets shooting through the cell says Wittmann
    - Knowing one step of the dance though does not explain the ballet he admits The whole cellular protein network is an integrated system so one of the conundrums in biology right now is how this network works together and what role individual elements play Genomewide sequencing has given us a parts list but we still have a long way to go to figure out what each protein does
    - Growth factor stimulated human breast cancer cells stained for actin blue nuclei green and the Golgi apparatus purple See larger
    - Disturbing the genetic controls that regulate the accuracy of a cells internal organization can disrupt normal cell behavior such as directed cell migration This disruption could in turn explain what happens when cancer cells spill from their original tumor and travel around the body a process known as metastasis which is the cause of most cancer deaths
    - Correct cellular movements are also essential for normal development For example certain microtubulemotor proteins guide nerve cells along the correct migration routes in the brain from their birthplace in a neural fold to the cortex It can be catastrophic if they lose their way Wittmann adds
    - Differentiating neuroblastoma cells stained for microtubules purple actin green See larger
    - The same might be said for science in general should the fashionable rush toward translational research which packages grant proposals around their potential shortterm impact on diseases and conditions undercut such primary research as that surrounding cellular events Wittmann refuses to be pessimistic Writing grants forces you to focus on the problem at hand and what your research is trying to contribute Id rather be trying to find a solution to a real problem anyway
    - Then again thats easy to say when the problems staring back at you from the microscope are manifested in dazzling and mysterious patterns Maybe thats why Wittmann has taken up photography as a hobby

    title: Are You a Science Impostor? Self-Help PhD Valerie Young
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - High achievers like science graduate students or postdocs are often thought to be immune to selfdoubt And indeed some project such unbridled confidence that it is easy to imagine that it is a group trait
    - Better think again
    - Putting aside such overcompensating fraudsters as South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang WooSuk graduate students and postdocs form a special class of selfdoubters says Valerie Young a psychology PhD from the University of Massachusetts who for the last years has circled the country lecturing on her favorite word topic And what might that topic be
    - How to Feel as Bright and Capable as Everyone Seems to Think You Are What Every Woman and Man Need to Know About Competence the Impostor Syndrome and the Art of Winging It
    - Young recently made backtoback presentations courtesy of UCSFs Center for Gender Equity at UCSFs Parnassus and Mission Bay campuses At her Genentech Hall appearance Young regaled an audience of about professional student impostors with anecdotes aphorisms and observations designed to illuminate and reassure
    - So who exactly qualifies as an impostor Young has pooled a series of questions which if answered truthfully are designed to pour a little hot water on our waxen public personae
    - Impostors fear being exposed says Young And they attribute any success they might have had to luck others help others mistakes or their charm While Youngs atrisk groups range from firstgeneration professionals to people in creative fields Young places students particularly female students near the top of the list
    - Students can get very stressed out Sometimes they will drop out of school because they dont feel deserving says Young who admits to once having suffered from ABD a procrastinating state defined as all but the dissertation
    - For aspiring women of science who to generalize lack the boasting bullshitting and bragging experience so critical to a mans ability to wing it in pressure situations a competitive laboratory environment can ratchet up feelings of failure Lets face it says Young when it comes to failures and mistakes girls internalize and boys externalize If a woman fails a test she blames herself If a guy fails the same test the professor was stupid
    - The riff continues If men make mistakes they only count if they get caught Women confess
    - Impostorism is not just a womans problem Young acknowledges Men suffer from it too It all comes down to how a person defines what it means to be competent
    - To that point Young singles out six different expert personalities that impostors wear like a brittle shell There is the perfectionist who wants to live an errorfree life the rugged individualist for whom success is always a solo endeavor the expert who needs to know percent of everything the natural genius who thinks intelligence should be innate Then there is the super student who needs to sign up for everything and excel incessantly and the extremist who feels overcompetent based on only occasional moments of brilliance
    - The sad fact adds Young is that these feelings of being an impostor dont subside with success Success makes it worse because now you have a reputation to defend And more visibility means more scrutiny and more accountability scary prospects for the already insecure
    - So what to do
    - Well some people cope by covering up Young explains Some people dont let up for a second fearing everything will fall apart Others withhold ideas and opinions or procrastinate Still others use their charm or perceptiveness to get by but feel inauthentic for doing so And then there is always selfsabotage
    - There are no magic pills to break the impostor spell Young warns But there are commonsense steps that we all can take such as minimizing procrastination rehearsing success faking it until you make it accentuating the positive reframing and renaming failure is merely an opportunity to succeed anew and many others which together break the pattern of selfdoubt and help us to talk ourselves off the ledge
    - Young left her UCSF audience with a parting message Separate feelings from facts When youre a student youre here to learn Its OK to feel stupid but its not OK to think youre stupid
    - I might no longer be a student but I feel smarter already

    title: Are You a Science Impostor? Self-Help PhD Valerie Young
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - High achievers like science graduate students or postdocs are often thought to be immune to selfdoubt And indeed some project such unbridled confidence that it is easy to imagine that it is a group trait
    - Better think again
    - Putting aside such overcompensating fraudsters as South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang WooSuk graduate students and postdocs form a special class of selfdoubters says Valerie Young a psychology PhD from the University of Massachusetts who for the last years has circled the country lecturing on her favorite word topic And what might that topic be
    - How to Feel as Bright and Capable as Everyone Seems to Think You Are What Every Woman and Man Need to Know About Competence the Impostor Syndrome and the Art of Winging It
    - Young recently made backtoback presentations courtesy of UCSFs Center for Gender Equity at UCSFs Parnassus and Mission Bay campuses At her Genentech Hall appearance Young regaled an audience of about professional student impostors with anecdotes aphorisms and observations designed to illuminate and reassure
    - So who exactly qualifies as an impostor Young has pooled a series of questions which if answered truthfully are designed to pour a little hot water on our waxen public personae
    - Impostors fear being exposed says Young And they attribute any success they might have had to luck others help others mistakes or their charm While Youngs atrisk groups range from firstgeneration professionals to people in creative fields Young places students particularly female students near the top of the list
    - Students can get very stressed out Sometimes they will drop out of school because they dont feel deserving says Young who admits to once having suffered from ABD a procrastinating state defined as all but the dissertation
    - For aspiring women of science who to generalize lack the boasting bullshitting and bragging experience so critical to a mans ability to wing it in pressure situations a competitive laboratory environment can ratchet up feelings of failure Lets face it says Young when it comes to failures and mistakes girls internalize and boys externalize If a woman fails a test she blames herself If a guy fails the same test the professor was stupid
    - The riff continues If men make mistakes they only count if they get caught Women confess
    - Impostorism is not just a womans problem Young acknowledges Men suffer from it too It all comes down to how a person defines what it means to be competent
    - To that point Young singles out six different expert personalities that impostors wear like a brittle shell There is the perfectionist who wants to live an errorfree life the rugged individualist for whom success is always a solo endeavor the expert who needs to know percent of everything the natural genius who thinks intelligence should be innate Then there is the super student who needs to sign up for everything and excel incessantly and the extremist who feels overcompetent based on only occasional moments of brilliance
    - The sad fact adds Young is that these feelings of being an impostor dont subside with success Success makes it worse because now you have a reputation to defend And more visibility means more scrutiny and more accountability scary prospects for the already insecure
    - So what to do
    - Well some people cope by covering up Young explains Some people dont let up for a second fearing everything will fall apart Others withhold ideas and opinions or procrastinate Still others use their charm or perceptiveness to get by but feel inauthentic for doing so And then there is always selfsabotage
    - There are no magic pills to break the impostor spell Young warns But there are commonsense steps that we all can take such as minimizing procrastination rehearsing success faking it until you make it accentuating the positive reframing and renaming failure is merely an opportunity to succeed anew and many others which together break the pattern of selfdoubt and help us to talk ourselves off the ledge
    - Young left her UCSF audience with a parting message Separate feelings from facts When youre a student youre here to learn Its OK to feel stupid but its not OK to think youre stupid
    - I might no longer be a student but I feel smarter already

    title: Do You See What I See? A Conversation with MD-PhD Jonathan Horton
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Have you ever wondered what the world really looked like
    - This might seem a silly question at first But consider this Colors shapes faces you name it pass through a series of relay stations in the brain beginning with the retina At each station the visual information is processed creating an image that we ultimately and instantaneously interpret as sight Yet is what were seeing full and complete or a shorthand version And to dabble for a moment in science fiction are we all seeing the same things
    - Jonathan Horton
    - Sight is perception says Jonathan Horton MD PhD a former historymajorturnedscientist who now heads UCSFs Laboratory for Visual Neuroscience Its a process where information is extracted transformed and distilled Thats where I come in he adds I try to understand how visual information is represented at each stage how it is coded and then passed on
    - But can we reverse the process I wonder and in doing so reconstruct reality Our understanding of what the visual system is doing is too incomplete to get a coherent view of what the real stimulus is Horton concedes Or maybe the concept is just too disruptive or too esoteric for science to either tackle or test
    - Horton thinks not Were in the very early stages but eventually we will have a complete enough description of the visual system to know what operation is being carried out at each level And then we will be in a position to infer exactly how the visual system enables us to see
    - Its been a long haul The visual system has been one of the most studied brain systems in science Johannes Kepler first explained the optics of the eye in Even today probably hundreds if not thousands of researchers study some aspect of sight either directly to help patients or as a model for how the brain works
    - Horton does both The yearold San Mateo California resident and father of three spent years acquiring the research and clinical skills that have made him an expert in understanding the visual cortex and in treating strabismus and amblyopia commonly referred to as crossed eyes and lazy eye
    - These conditions create a lot of disability and difficulty for children and adults he explains And it turns out that both are diseases of the central visual system diseases of what we call binocular integration or how two eyes yield a single seamless image
    - Follow the red cross which patterns how we scan an image for content and watch as these scans are stitched together and projected in the brains visual cortex
    - Horton sees patients one day every week and whether he confronts unexplained vision loss or ophthalmic nerve disorders he attacks the problems with the same curiosity that first enticed him into the field of vision as an admittedly awestruck medical student Sometimes I just dont know whats wrong and I cant offer much help But then there are times when I can actually treat and solve a problem and that is very satisfying
    - Still there remains the underlying mystery of how we see a mystery that exerts as powerful an attraction on him as those mountain peaks in California and the Andes that he so loves to hike and climb
    - I picked history as an undergraduate major because I wanted to understand how people work You can do that by studying the human condition and looking at the historical record As a scientist you can also do that by cutting up brains and studying them under the microscope
    - This is not some ghoulish game Horton is playing There is something very fundamental at work here a discovery process that has already forced him to rethink what vision is
    - Torsten Wittmann
    - If you look at how dogs cats monkeys and humans see you find the same basic process Horton explains Yet there are surprising differences inside their brains
    - In many mammals for example cells that share the same visual receptors are organized into columns When you see enough of these socalled ocular dominance columns which are particularly wellorganized in humans you begin to assume that they are standard structures essential for sight Guess again In squirrel monkeys says Horton some have columns and some dont And the variations can be almost whimsical Yet the monkeys can all see
    - So what does this mean Horton remains typically lowkey even as he describes how his negative discovery has shaken orthodox views Perhaps the columns are the brain equivalent of spandrels Spandrels Those roughly rectangularshaped corners created when the curve of an arch meets the ceiling A spandrel is what you get when you make an arch he says The same kind of thing could be happening in the brain
    - Which would mean that we really dont know why these columns exist at all Yes says Horton This was a serendipitous discovery but it shows that were still at an early stage in understanding the brain and the structures within it
    - It also opens the door to an extraordinary possibility Horton maps the visual cortex so he is loath to generalize Still as a former historian who once studied the work of medieval scientist Thomas Bradwardine a preNewtonian who turned out to be only halfright about the mechanics of the universe Horton appreciates that research questions have intrinsic value because they stimulate thought
    - Any child of the s was taught that all brains are equal that we all start out with the same intelligence that our brains are a tabula rasa and that whatever the environment loads in is what influences us It might be politically incorrect now to extrapolate from what we have learned about other mammals into human potentialities but I think this old philosophy is on the wane
    - There might be quite a bit of structural difference from person to person It would be very dicey to tease them out and very difficult to substantiate without bias but we could one day find that there is a rich variation in brain organization among humans
    - When you think about that for a moment certain assumptions begin to fade like winter shadows at the North Pole Maybe the next frontier is out there just beyond our fingertips Maybe there is a whole new visual language to learn Maybe well seeing is not believing at least in the way we think it is And maybe its time to open our eyes to new possibilities and to appreciate anew how science can invigorate reason and lead us all to the mountaintop

    title: "Ace of Hearts: A Conversation with Developmental Biologist and Cardiologist Deepak Srivastava"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Deepak Srivastava MD remembers his first broken heart It came from a frog
    - It happened in my high school biology class I had to dissect out a frog heart and when I did it continued to beat in the petri dish I couldnt believe it I was totally enamored So I took it home
    - The heart finally gave out around midnight some hours later My parents kidded me about watching it until the end but I thought it was the coolest thing Ever since then I have been fascinated by the heart
    - No wonder then that the yearold Srivastava is happy in his work As director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease the LA and Texasreared and selfdescribed man in a hurry is riding a wave of excitement about cardiac stem cells It is a wave he helped generate with his earlier work at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and one he continues to build since returning to San Francisco in During his previous stint at UCSF as a pediatrics resident Srivastava met his future wife a pediatric clinical research nurse
    - I feel compelled to understand the causes of heart disease and create new interventions for them says the man who once aspired to an investment banking career before seeing the light Millions have a stake in his success heart disease remains the countrys number one killer And while Srivastava concentrates on how genetic defects arise specifically the molecular events that instruct socalled progenitor cells to fashion a normal heart or as in one out of live births a malformed version he remains a basic scientist with a clinicians instincts
    - We approach heart problems from both sides of the equation which is a little unusual says Srivastava who runs his own person lab while overseeing another or so institute scientists Most heart researchers are trained either as human geneticists who work with patients to try to find their diseasecausing genes or they are trained as molecular or developmental biologists and they work with animal models We do both And we go back and forth interrogating peoples DNA to try to understand the mechanisms underlying disease
    - Deepak Srivastava
    - Interrogation and integration have worked well so far Some examples Over the last decade Srivastava and his colleagues have come to understand a network of genes that compel an undifferentiated cell to become a heart cell They also have teased out how to both direct a cell to its fate and keep the production line for future cells in operation Moreover he has found that some of the same genes that make a heart are the ones that directly cause human childhood and adult heart disease when mutated
    - And in what might serve as a screaming headline for translational research and a tribute to its serendipitous nature Srivastava and his research team have also found a protein called thymosin beta that has not one not two but three remarkable properties
    - First thymosin beta is critically important to cell movement in a developing heart which is why researchers in Srivastavas lab studying how congenital defects occur first found it interesting
    - Second thymosin beta protects heart cells from dying when they dont get enough oxygen And third it stimulates the formation of new blood vessels
    - You can almost hear the dots connecting A number of animal tests later Srivastava and his collaborators learned that thymosin beta which is a small enough protein to be made synthetically both protects and repairs cells damaged in a heart attack at least in mice Will the same prove true for humans The answer could come sooner than we think Phase I clinical trials in human heart attack patients will begin at UCSF and elsewhere around the country next year
    - Of course not every lead pursued in the lab can turn up something as promising as thymosin beta But there is a confidence about Srivastava the father of three that is reassuring even in a research area like stem cells which is so fraught with hype
    - Once you get a cell to become what you want it to and then get them in enough numbers you have to figure out how to deliver them properly to the organ of choice and then have them integrate appropriately with the cells already there and not get rejected Srivastava says without hesitation Daunting Yes But not insurmountable Each of them can be addressed Srivastava adds cheerfully
    - Indeed if you had to name the vibe that most aptly describes a man who traded Wall Street for Owens Street it is cheerfulness laced with selfawareness and certainty Srivastava who likes to read books about the nature of leadership being genuinely caring is key concedes that it was not always so
    - During the first week of school during my senior year at Rice University I met a freshman English major who ended up helping me paint my room She kept asking me all these deep questions about my life and what I wanted to do with it I was an economics major at the time but by am it was crystalclear in my mind that I should not become an investment banker that I should become a scientist instead The next morning I changed all my classes and I never debated or reconsidered my decision again
    - Fortunately Srivastava liked science his father is a biochemist and had taken enough courses to at least apply to medical school He was only but he was accepted
    - Now as he leads an internationally prominent institute across the street from UCSFs Mission Bay campus does Srivastava ever think back to that night in Houston when his life changed forever Yes Im still close friends with the woman who asked me all those questions She takes enormous credit for what Im doing and she deserves it
    - If Srivastavas research continues to go well it seems she will not be the only one applauding

    - Second thymosin beta protects heart cells from dying when they dont get enough oxygen And third it stimulates the formation of new blood vessels
    - You can almost hear the dots connecting A number of animal tests later Srivastava and his collaborators learned that thymosin beta which is a small enough protein to be made synthetically both protects and repairs cells damaged in a heart attack at least in mice Will the same prove true for humans The answer could come sooner than we think Phase I clinical trials in human heart attack patients will begin at UCSF and elsewhere around the country next year
    - Of course not every lead pursued in the lab can turn up something as promising as thymosin beta But there is a confidence about Srivastava the father of three that is reassuring even in a research area like stem cells which is so fraught with hype
    - Once you get a cell to become what you want it to and then get them in enough numbers you have to figure out how to deliver them properly to the organ of choice and then have them integrate appropriately with the cells already there and not get rejected Srivastava says without hesitation Daunting Yes But not insurmountable Each of them can be addressed Srivastava adds cheerfully
    - Indeed if you had to name the vibe that most aptly describes a man who traded Wall Street for Owens Street it is cheerfulness laced with selfawareness and certainty Srivastava who likes to read books about the nature of leadership being genuinely caring is key concedes that it was not always so
    - During the first week of school during my senior year at Rice University I met a freshman English major who ended up helping me paint my room She kept asking me all these deep questions about my life and what I wanted to do with it I was an economics major at the time but by am it was crystalclear in my mind that I should not become an investment banker that I should become a scientist instead The next morning I changed all my classes and I never debated or reconsidered my decision again
    - Fortunately Srivastava liked science his father is a biochemist and had taken enough courses to at least apply to medical school He was only but he was accepted
    - Now as he leads an internationally prominent institute across the street from UCSFs Mission Bay campus does Srivastava ever think back to that night in Houston when his life changed forever Yes Im still close friends with the woman who asked me all those questions She takes enormous credit for what Im doing and she deserves it
    - If Srivastavas research continues to go well it seems she will not be the only one applauding

    title: "Stupid Science: Can Moviemakers Ever Get It Right?"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - An Inconvenient Truth aside science does not really figure into this years Academy Awards unless you also count the chemistry that sometimes bonds audience to actor or that builds among ensemble casts
    - And maybe thats a relief Science separate from science fiction does not usually fare well at the hands of moviemakers There are countless examples but my personal favorite for best worst science goes to the Brian De Palma film Mission to Mars The screenplay stumbles from the silly to the absurd leaving so many science goofs behind its a wonder that the red planet didnt blush an even deeper shade of scarlet
    - I thought I was alone in my guffaws but I have found a likeminded soul at the Goofs for Mission to Mars website
    - Here is one mistake from a long list While looking at a DNA sequence Terri Fisher says that the last two chromosomes are missing What is missing is actually the last two nucleotides DNA does not have chromosomes Or how about this one That DNA looks human Enough said
    - Jim McConnell Gary Sinise and Phil Ohlmyer Jerry OConnell study a DNA model that Phil has created with candy in Touchstones Mission To Mars PhotoTouchstone Pictures
    - Guess the screenwriters didnt use the services of Hollywood Math and Science Film Consulting which promises to ensure that the technical details and jargon in your script sound believable whether they be mathematical scientific or medical Moreover the consulting firm guarantees that the backdrops in your scenes the writing on the blackboards the equipment in the labs look realistic that your universities look like universities and your academics act like academics
    - At least the company was started by a biochemist and a mathematician But you still have to ask what makes an academic act like an academic or a health sciences university like UCSF look like a university Labs you might say That would be true of course but notice that the company only promises that the lab equipment will look realistic Why not use the real thing Wouldnt it be easier And if a real lab doesnt look realistic I am curious to know what elements this consulting firm would recommend Lots more colored tape Polished beakers Clean and ordered space Now that would be VERY unrealistic
    - In the meantime there are other science watchdogs out there keeping keen and witty eyes on bad science on the screen Topping the list would have to be Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics It has a rating system from GP generally good physics to XP physics from an unknown universe The site is fun and clever and along the way you can brush up on why bullets dont flash why gas tanks usually dont ignite and why the truth about sound and sound effects is more complicated than you think By the way creators of the site have ranked the film The Core as the best worst science movie ever Its so bad its good they claim
    - Another site Phil Plaits Bad Astronomy offers further evidence that science is at risk in movieland And while I dont want to beat a dead horse there is a special section devoted to yes Mission to Mars
    - Movies and Science is also informative although the PowerPoint format is a little clunky No surprise Mission to Mars got a on their rating scale despite as the sites creators assert NASAs deep involvement in the project Hmmm
    - Weird Science catalogues mistakes in science fiction films if you are interested in that kind of rulesoffantasy game playing Its difficult enough for me to keep the real science straight
    - And that is the point Real science can be fun revealing and sometimes startling even if the process can be tedious and frustrating characteristics that we all understand dont translate well into drama OK I confess I liked the film Gattaca But behind the frustrating process are great and stimulating ideas that can shake society to its core ultimately save lives and perhaps ennoble human existence Thats the movie UCSF stars in and one that we should never tire of watching

    title: "Hard Drugs: A Conversation with Pharmaceutical Chemist Tom James"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Did you know that the Sumerian ideogram for opium means joy Or that drugs have been around for at least years
    - Indeed when you think about it migratory humans of an even earlier vintage likely learned enough about plants to pick up a few other medicinal tricks mindbending or otherwise And lets not forget about the Wise Man and his gift of myrrh Myrrh is an antiinflammatory compound still used today in mouthwashes to relieve sore throat
    - In the eons since weve added to our drug discovery tricks with recombinant DNA techniques gene chips computer programs microarrays highthroughput systems and a host of other clever technologies But the promise of modern drugmaking chemistry so proudly touted in media reports press releases and science journals has not always yielded products
    - True we have a lot more than yearold opium in our apothecary at the moment But there are still many shelves sitting empty
    - Tom James PhD chair of UCSFs Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry thinks he knows why
    - University scientists find drug targets that suggest ways to block or reverse a diseasecausing process by binding one chemical compound to another Pharmaceutical companies fund therapies And this being a capitalistic system there has to be some payoff to the investment What kind of payoff A million market per year give or take a few million James estimates From the industry perspective its understandable The financial risks of developing drugs are huge he adds
    - Among the risks is outright failure One might argue about the odds be they to one or to one but the sad truth is that most promising chemical compounds flame out long before they make it to a formulary Those that do succeed may burn through million or so to make the grade
    - The opium poppy Papaver somniferum As far back as the fourth millennium BC the Sumerians referred to this poppy with the ideogram HUL GIL plant of joy
    - The implications are clear says James who uses nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to study dynamic structures of proteins and nucleic acids as well as small moleculemacromolecule interactions in search of molecules that bind together Drug targets for chronic diseases like heart disease or high cholesterol where you have to take medications for the rest of your life are considered more important than those for acute diseases that can be knocked out with a single treatment
    - If your potential drug target happens to counter a disease or condition with a small patient population even if its a chronic disease you slip farther down the money chain And if the disease is concentrated among the poor in the developing world your potential drug is a nonstarter unless of course you choose to turn that minus into a plus and create a nonprofit drug company as UCSF pharmaceutical chemistry PhD Victoria Hale has done with her San Francisco based organization the Institute for OneWorld Health
    - This is not to mention those pesky human studies the results of which can undermine even the surest of sure bets Thats why infectious diseases caused by parasites or fungi are so attractive to some researchers says James You can selectively mess with a process distinct in the organisms biochemistry and knock it out minimizing worry about side effects Its obviously a different story in humans
    - Indeed the whole drug discovery and delivery process is so cumbersome expensive and complex it makes you wonder how drugs happen at all
    - th century BC Sumerian stone tablet
    - Its true that opportunities are lost says James University scientists are very good at finding novel targets or novel compounds And we know a lot more about their biochemistry structure and function than we ever have before But the odds are always against success
    - The odds worsen when you consider the sheer number of compounds that chemists could possibly make There are a lot of arguments about what number to use since many theoretical compounds would be so unstable they simply wouldnt stay together long Nonetheless James likes the big figure the one with a and zeros behind it Thats more compounds than there are grains of sand he explains
    - How many do we know about so far If we scrounged around in every lab in the world in every nook and cranny we might come up with million compounds James responds That leaves a pretty high sand dune to climb
    - So whats the solution First James recommends that university scientists keep up the good work and stay smart Theres no way to get through the long list of possible compounds by trial and error It simply cant be done So we need to learn as much as we can about structure and function to guide our screening studies
    - Second concentrate initially on smaller molecules those with a molecular weight under Its true that a lot of drugs the antibacterials being the best example have a molecular weight higher than so you need to keep an open mind But smaller molecules are less likely to provoke an immune response and are usually easier to deliver to the site of action unimpaired
    - Colcichine a treatment for gout was originally derived from the stem and seeds of the meadow saffron ImageNational Agricultural Library ARS USDA
    - Third James suggests it might be time to reconsider our drug patent laws which were changed in to add three years to what once was a year limit Part of the reason why drug companies are reluctant to pick up on some leads or why they develop series of metoo drugs to keep patents alive is that they dont think years is long enough Maybe if we extend the time by a couple of years in return for lower drug costs we might be able to get some new drugs to market that wouldnt make it otherwise
    - Its a policy question James clearly feels uncomfortable even discussing But the fact that he feels compelled to do so should give us all pause as we reach into medicine cabinets for our daily dose of remediation Nothing in life is guaranteed not even our drug supply If we want a healthy tomorrow it seems we had better keep basic science strong today
    - Just keep thinking of all those grains of sand

    title: "A Speck of Spec: A Conversation with Al Burlingame"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Time of flight Liquid matrix secondary ion sputtering Electron capture Electrospray Laser desorption Beam transport
    - Can anyone tell me what these have to do with CSI Miami
    - Nothing And everything You see when those CSI lab sleuths snatch their paper readouts and name the distinctive elements in skin secretions or the pollen from an obscure plant melodramatics aside they are talking the language of mass spectrometry
    - Mass spec as it is commonly called uses sensitive measuring techniques based on electrical charge and mass and some very expensive machines costing as much as million each to identify and separate molecules even if they exist in only infinitesimal amounts Some popular uses have nabbed athletes on steroids or determined dioxin levels in contaminated fish
    - Mass spec can also reveal the structure and properties of molecules in complex biological samples a particularly useful perspective when trying to understand how health and disease are influenced by the fluid and ceaseless activity inside a cell
    - Not surprisingly for a technology so specialized mass spec has its own language Fortunately for many researchers at UCSF and others around the world that language has been spoken fluently for the last years by Al Burlingame PhD director of the School of Pharmacys Mass Spectrometry Facility UCSFs own king of mass spec
    - While the yearold Burlingame resists being called UCSFs king of spec truth be told his career has spanned several complete and total changes in technology all of which have only whetted his curiosity Weve gone from vaporizing samples to fast atom bombardment to electron capture he explains And in doing so sensitivity has increased by to the third or more
    - Sensitivity to what you might ask To the mechanics of life is one answer which sounds nice but doesnt explain much How about this We all know that proteins literally make us and also make us work We also know that genes encode proteins and that genes are regulated or in other words that they are turned on and off But as Burlingame reminds us There are processes by which proteins are switched on and off too by other proteins These processes are not directly encoded in genomics Defining those systems and processes are where we are focused
    - Put another way says Burlingame Knowing which genes are turned on and off in a cell does not reliably predict which proteins are there how much of each protein is present how the proteins have been chemically modified or how they might interact with other proteins Proteins clearly affect how cells act so knowing more about them is well key to knowing everything
    - That brings us full circle to mass spec technology which got a Nobel Prizewinning boost in the early s when new techniques allowed bigger molecules like proteins to be more efficiently ionized or electrically charged and more specifically analyzed Years before almost everything had to be vaporized first before you could do anything says Burlingame Now the sample can also be a solid or a liquid before it is injected into the vacuum chamber In the case of protein samples Burlingame explains fragments are separated out beforehand by another technique called affinity chromatography But thats another story
    - What happens next is a powerful mix of physics and chemistry But in essence because the different molecules that make up the sample have different charges and mass it is possible to analyze and identify them based on for example how long they stay airborne
    - Were basically profiling proteins says Burlingame because techniques have advanced to the point where we can study them directly And when you consider that humans likely host hundreds of thousands of proteins one can imagine the embarrassment of riches spilling from the machines in UCSFs Mass Spectrometry Facility as well as from those in the or so other similar facilities around the world
    - Its a bioinformatics bottleneck one reason why School of Pharmacy faculty have been hosting the software research engine ProteinProspector for nearly years The ProteinProspector visited by users each month allows researchers to process very large data sets and to measure and compare several thousand proteins in a single experiment
    - Burlingame and his colleagues are heavy users themselves Were trying to sort out this mess he laughs knowing that evolution has not made it easy Human cells are very difficult to deal with analytically which is why we are trying to define whats happening by dividing and conquering their parts
    - In the meantime Burlingame has teamed up with scientists at UCSF and elsewhere to study everything from the p pathway in cancer to learning and memory Learning and memory is really an emerging field for us Burlingame explains Then warming to the task he adds There are at least phosphorylation sites in the postsynaptic parts of brain regions associated with it Its going to be quite a job
    - But then thats why mass spec has such a big name When you set out to globally penetrate the composition of human cells as Burlingame reminds us you had better be ready to think large

    title: "A Speck of Spec: A Conversation with Al Burlingame"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Time of flight Liquid matrix secondary ion sputtering Electron capture Electrospray Laser desorption Beam transport
    - Can anyone tell me what these have to do with CSI Miami
    - Nothing And everything You see when those CSI lab sleuths snatch their paper readouts and name the distinctive elements in skin secretions or the pollen from an obscure plant melodramatics aside they are talking the language of mass spectrometry
    - Mass spec as it is commonly called uses sensitive measuring techniques based on electrical charge and mass and some very expensive machines costing as much as million each to identify and separate molecules even if they exist in only infinitesimal amounts Some popular uses have nabbed athletes on steroids or determined dioxin levels in contaminated fish
    - Mass spec can also reveal the structure and properties of molecules in complex biological samples a particularly useful perspective when trying to understand how health and disease are influenced by the fluid and ceaseless activity inside a cell
    - Not surprisingly for a technology so specialized mass spec has its own language Fortunately for many researchers at UCSF and others around the world that language has been spoken fluently for the last years by Al Burlingame PhD director of the School of Pharmacys Mass Spectrometry Facility UCSFs own king of mass spec
    - While the yearold Burlingame resists being called UCSFs king of spec truth be told his career has spanned several complete and total changes in technology all of which have only whetted his curiosity Weve gone from vaporizing samples to fast atom bombardment to electron capture he explains And in doing so sensitivity has increased by to the third or more
    - Sensitivity to what you might ask To the mechanics of life is one answer which sounds nice but doesnt explain much How about this We all know that proteins literally make us and also make us work We also know that genes encode proteins and that genes are regulated or in other words that they are turned on and off But as Burlingame reminds us There are processes by which proteins are switched on and off too by other proteins These processes are not directly encoded in genomics Defining those systems and processes are where we are focused
    - Put another way says Burlingame Knowing which genes are turned on and off in a cell does not reliably predict which proteins are there how much of each protein is present how the proteins have been chemically modified or how they might interact with other proteins Proteins clearly affect how cells act so knowing more about them is well key to knowing everything
    - That brings us full circle to mass spec technology which got a Nobel Prizewinning boost in the early s when new techniques allowed bigger molecules like proteins to be more efficiently ionized or electrically charged and more specifically analyzed Years before almost everything had to be vaporized first before you could do anything says Burlingame Now the sample can also be a solid or a liquid before it is injected into the vacuum chamber In the case of protein samples Burlingame explains fragments are separated out beforehand by another technique called affinity chromatography But thats another story
    - What happens next is a powerful mix of physics and chemistry But in essence because the different molecules that make up the sample have different charges and mass it is possible to analyze and identify them based on for example how long they stay airborne
    - Were basically profiling proteins says Burlingame because techniques have advanced to the point where we can study them directly And when you consider that humans likely host hundreds of thousands of proteins one can imagine the embarrassment of riches spilling from the machines in UCSFs Mass Spectrometry Facility as well as from those in the or so other similar facilities around the world
    - Its a bioinformatics bottleneck one reason why School of Pharmacy faculty have been hosting the software research engine ProteinProspector for nearly years The ProteinProspector visited by users each month allows researchers to process very large data sets and to measure and compare several thousand proteins in a single experiment
    - Burlingame and his colleagues are heavy users themselves Were trying to sort out this mess he laughs knowing that evolution has not made it easy Human cells are very difficult to deal with analytically which is why we are trying to define whats happening by dividing and conquering their parts
    - In the meantime Burlingame has teamed up with scientists at UCSF and elsewhere to study everything from the p pathway in cancer to learning and memory Learning and memory is really an emerging field for us Burlingame explains Then warming to the task he adds There are at least phosphorylation sites in the postsynaptic parts of brain regions associated with it Its going to be quite a job
    - But then thats why mass spec has such a big name When you set out to globally penetrate the composition of human cells as Burlingame reminds us you had better be ready to think large

    title: "Express Yourself: A Conversation with Chris Barker, Director of the Genomics Core Laboratory"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Chris Barker
    - Modern science feeds on ideas But ideas without technology are like a chef without a fully equipped kitchen You cant taste success without testing it first
    - Chris Barker PhD knows all about scientific appetites As director of the Genomics Core Laboratory at the UCSFaffiliated J David Gladstone Institutes for the last six years he has parlayed a career as an itinerant scientist into one as a manager of discoveries
    - Science is a business something that young scientists dont always understand right away We are paid to make discoveries just like Bill Gates has to create software for compensation
    - It is a lesson the yearold Barker a trained virologist learned early in his postdoctoral journey from Boston to Birmingham and from Philadelphia to Ann Arbor Ive always liked playing with toys yet it still took me a while to realize that I like to set things up be it a new system or a new lab The truth is too that I have a short attention span Its not a good idea for me to go after a problem where I have to selectively focus for an extended period of time
    - Instead Barker now helps other scientists intensely focus on a project and follow it logically
    - How does the onetime vice president of molecular biology a position Barker once held at a life sciences startup manage this To answer that question we first need to understand a bit about DNA microarray technology which excuse the pun is at the core of the Genomics Core Laboratory where Barkers two employees and half a dozen or so gene chip scanners and networked computers generate their mounds of data
    - We all know that most cells in our body contain a full complement of genes and chromosomes We also understand that not all of the genes are turned on in the same way or to the same degree in every cell If they were all of our or so different cell types from bone to skin wouldnt exist which means that neither you nor I would either Instead we would all be obliviously living out our lives as singlecelled bacteria or algae
    - Be thankful then that humans are multicellular organisms with big brains and that we have used these brains to give the process that makes our different cells a name That name is gene expression Put a little more scientifically gene expression is the term used to describe what happens when the information that genes contain is transcribed by messenger RNA and translated into proteins
    - DNA microarrays which arose from an earlier macroarray technology of the s tap into this expression process by exploiting the fact that messenger RNA molecules bind to the specific DNA segments they originally transcribed In gene expression studies that use microarray technology cells from diseased tissue can be probed with fluorescently labeled nucleic acid molecules digitally photographed and then analyzed by special computer software to reveal the level of gene expression
    - Imagine for example being able to track back from a cancer cell to a specific gene or set of genes and you begin to understand how essential such research has become to uncovering the underlying mechanisms of disease The same is true for tumor classification risk assessment prognosis drug development and drug response all of which have been transformed by this ability to see and hear the marquee speakers at the genome convention
    - The microarray process also can work the other way around Place nucleotides associated with known gene sequences on a glass slide and then run tissue samples against them and the same binding process will reveal the relative abundance of tens of thousands of genes all from a chip about half the size of a standard Postit note
    - With so much potential data researchers could quickly drown in the deluge without a manager like Barker to orchestrate the discovery process at the outset Well do what any researcher wants but in the project description that all scientists are required to fill out we ask specifically what they are trying to accomplish And then we sit down with them and ask the important questions Scientists always know what they want but they have varying degrees of information about what they can get
    - And before anyone picks up a pipette Barker recruits a biostatistician to review the proposal to ensure that robust statistical data will rise to the top
    - When you boil down a DNA microarray experiment what youre really doing is getting a comparison PIs principal investigators need to decide what comparisons they want to do Its a big decision because the arrays have expanded now There are a lot more options and the samples can be tiny Its not an exaggeration to say that we can compare anything
    - The tests themselves cost anywhere from to each And even the simplest studies in what Barker describes as his milliondollar lab usually require at least three test samples and three real samples No one knew in the early days how much biological noise would spill out when you are running so many gene tests at once Barker explains Now six to tests are the norm with some clinical studies requiring or more
    - The list of scientists making their way to Gladstone headquarters at UCSF Mission Bay including Frank McCormick PhD Doug Hanahan PhD Thea Tlsty PhD Shaun Coughlin MD PhD and Mike McManus PhD among dozens of others reads like a UCSF Whos Who And why not Microarrays are cool clean and contentrich if a little laborintensive to produce
    - Better yet they serve Barkers higher purpose Im a bookworm When I was a child I used to read encyclopedias These days I also think of myself as a translator someone who has lived in and escaped the postdoc ghetto who knows how to put together a lab from the ground up and who understands the experimental side of science
    - To this list of titles we should also add budding Italian cook I gave up my lab bench a long time ago Barker laughs Now I do my molecular biology at the stove I want to have fun Science taught me that

    title: How Do You Sleep? A Conversation with Tom Neylan, MD
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - O Sleep rest of all things mildest of the gods balm of the soul
    - When the Roman poet Ovid crafted this tribute to Hypnos the Greek god of sleep he captured the essence of sleeps restorative power Yet in the centuries since the reign of Augustus the what and why behind a good sleep and its evil twin insomnia named coincidentally for Somnus the Roman god of sleep have eluded scientists
    - Tom Neylan
    - But as Sojourner Truth once wrote its often darkest just before dawn These days sleep experts like San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center SFVAMC psychiatrist Tom Neylan MD are shedding more light on the biology of sleep and uncovering what sleep disorders can do to our health
    - Its an exciting time for researchers like me who are trying to understand the role of sleep in our lives he says Sadly for most of the last years Neylan who operates out of an Art Decoera medical building in the UCSFaffiliated facility in northwestern San Francisco has developed his insights from the damaged lives of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD For these hypervigilant patients many of whom are women uninterrupted restorative sleep can be a near impossibility
    - Every living creature has a restorative cycle of some sort the youthful Neylan explains Since these cycles are conserved across species theyre probably related to something universal like the light and darkness cycles on Earth itself
    - We live this truth every day Circadian rhythms are hardwired into our DNA after all And while we understand that hour cycles govern the physiological processes of all living beings have you ever wondered as Neylan and many others have why this might be so
    - One popular theory is that our circadian rhythms stem from the need of the earliest cells to protect their replicating DNA from ultraviolet radiation during the daytime In short just like todays adolescents they saved all the action for nighttime then rested
    - Human sleep is more layered and complicated of course thanks in part to our dense and powerful brains Indeed as Neylan has confirmed in his own research The brain is the most vulnerable organ to sleep deprivation Or to put it a different way you lose if you dont snooze People with sleep problems have more health problems like heart disease high blood pressure and premature aging Neylan explains Theres no way to cheat the system Good sleep is an essential part of human biology Some of the latest research even shows that regular sleep is important to metabolism to keeping our weight in balance The effect of insomnia on energy balance is something I really want to explore
    - Keep in mind that when Neylan mentions sleep disorders hes not talking about an occasional restless night As medical director of the PTSD Program at SFVAMC he has spent years studying sleep disturbances in patients who are chronically sleepdeprived
    - Tom Neylan
    - Its difficult for people without PTSD to understand how severe trauma can create an anxious state that makes sleep difficult Youre haunted by memories Youre always scanning the environment for safety You have nightmares You withdraw Youre edgy You dont trust anyone And this doesnt always get better with time
    - In this world of real and imagined threats our natural defense system bends to a selfdestructive wind Look says Neylan we evolved in a predatorprey environment If the lions are next door insomnia is a good thing But what if we were always worried that they might be there Or that they are there when theyre not He leaves the question hanging in the air unanswered
    - But it is answers he seeks which is why this Mill Valley California resident has now begun a study that compares the sleeptime hormone patterns of men and women with and without PTSD His goal I am interested in finding effective interventions to help people with sleep disorders he responds without hesitation
    - One possibility is to block the effects of corticotropinreleasing factor CRF for short a peptide that underlies anxiety Higher levels of CRF are associated with sleep disturbances particularly when it comes to the deep sleep that the human system craves The brain seems to have evolved a pathway that keeps us aroused when we feel threatened and CRF might be in the drivers seat says Neylan For that reason CRF presents a novel target for drug developers he adds
    - Neylan keenly feels the need for new drugs or any other successful nondrug intervention to break the chain of pain that keeps trauma victims locked to their own memories I think people naturally associate PTSD with men and war but sexual and physical assault particularly rape happens to women far more often And the diagnosis and the effects on sleep and everything else are just the same when youre a civilian
    - Those psychological aftershocks do not extend to the Hollywood staple the violent flashback Severe flashbacks are relatively rare Its the avoidant behavior you really have to worry about because they leave you feeling cut off from humanity You become a bystander to life And for reasons we dont really understand women seem more vulnerable to PTSD than men With the war in Iraq destined to yield women who have undergone both war and assault Neylan knows what others can only sense More patients are on the way
    - Its a frustrating circumstance It may be a nave question but doesnt anything protect people who have been traumatized My colleagues and I have studied the risk for PTSD symptoms in police Strong social support networks and higher IQs offer some protection against the impact of traumatic events
    - Evolution seems to have given us a skimpy flak vest Nonetheless Neylan finds hope in the patients themselves When I was doing my residency training in the late s very few people liked to work with PTSD patients They thought they were always angry But that has completely turned around now Patients are interested in treatment And doctors are interested in helping them We work together as collaborators

    title: "Alcoholism: Vice or Disease? A Conversation with Howard Fields, Part&nbsp;1&nbsp;of&nbsp;3"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - What if we put cancer patients in jail Its a ridiculous thought of course No one chooses to get cancer Its a disease whose emergence is dictated by a complex interplay among environment lifestyle and genetics
    - Howard Fields
    - Using the same logic neuroscientist Howard Fields MD PhD a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of UCSFs Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction wonders then why we punish addicts
    - If you listen to addicts they say Im out of control I cant help it I cant stop myself I know I need help Thats what everyone needs to understand Most alcoholics would like to cut back on their drinking But some unconscious force makes them take that fifth or sixth drink even when they know they shouldnt This is a disease not a crime
    - Finding that unconscious force inside the human brain is the holy grail of Fields research Its a quest that has little use for the magic wand called willpower that society waves over the addiction problem as both an explanation and a solution Blaming a persons lack of willpower is another way of saying its your fault that you had a choice says Fields But who chooses to be an addict And what is willpower but just another manifestation of nerve cell activity
    - If not a failure of willpower then what is alcohol addiction Fields is quick with an answer To me the simplest way of thinking about it is impulsivity In other words if there is something immediately available you ignore the longterm consequences In fact the longer term the consequences are the less influence they will have over your current behavior This is what we as scientists have to understand How does your motivation for immediate reward outweigh your ability to wait for a larger pleasure
    - Toll Gate Saloon Black Hawk Colorado
    - Its a fascinating neurobiological conundrum that all of us either witness or participate in daily Think about it for a moment At some point in our lives almost everyone is exposed to alcohol Yet most people do not become alcoholics even those who drink small or moderate amounts daily
    - For perhaps percent to percent of us though and for reasons as yet unexplained drinking alcohol becomes an addiction with often disastrous consequences on our health our freedom and the lives of others The statistics are grim In addition to the trafficrelated fatalities alcohol abuse in the United States annually causes
    - What is going on inside the heads of these people society asks with both contempt and rage Fields has an answer of sorts When you compare alcoholics and controls as they decide between an immediate reward and a delayed one you see that chronic alcoholics are much more impulsive
    - Which came first the drinking or the impulsivity Its not an idle question and its one that Fields cannot yet answer We dont know if drinking causes impulsiveness or if innate impulsiveness makes alcoholics drink more
    - Frenchies Bar a cross roads store bar juke joint and gas station in Melrose Louisiana circa
    - Still some of the scientific murkiness is beginning to clear For example Fields and his colleagues have found that for those who prefer the delayed reward there is activity in different regions of the brain than if you prefer the immediate reward You can think of it as the neural correlates of the ego immediate gratification and superego longterm benefit Fields remarks The key point is that if there are different paths for processing immediate and delayed gratification then the underlying neural mechanism and biochemistry must be different as well
    - And if you understand these differences you are closer to understanding what makes alcoholics different The main point is that their brains are different and that is why they cannot stop drinking once they start
    - In the second part of Alcoholism Vice or Disease well explore the science that is beginning to uncover some of the secrets of impulsivity and how alcohol for some of us at least seems to unleash its spontaneous power

    title: "Alcoholism: Vice or Disease? A Conversation with Howard Fields, Part&nbsp;2&nbsp;of&nbsp;3"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Kappa delta mu sounds like a college fraternity And if you associate college with sometimes fatal outbursts of binge drinking the Greek letters might be a fitting label
    - Howard Fields
    - For neuroscientists though kappa delta and mu refer to opioid receptors large molecules found on the surface of neurons Opioids literally resembling opium which stems from the Greek word opion or poppy juice are a group of natural substances produced by the opium poppy plant Similaracting substances are also produced by the body when we are stressed or when we are anticipating reward Think endorphins
    - Neuroscientist Howard Fields MD PhD a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of UCSFs Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction believes that small differences in receptor activity might be a major culprit in alcoholism And in part of Alcoholism Vice or Disease he argued that addicts are more victims of biochemistry than of bad judgment
    - I want to be clear though Fields adds Higher degrees of impulsivity the genetics of which are still being worked out seem to be a risk factor for alcoholism But if you grow up in a Mormon community where there is strong pressure against drinking alcohol you probably will not become an alcoholic Take that same person though and put him or her in an environment where there is a lot of stress and people are relieving their anxiety by drinking and the results might be very different We have to always remember that there are a lot of reasons why people drink
    - And a lot of theories Fields acknowledges that the opioid receptor hypothesis is only one of many and none are yet proven In addition to opioids some scientists favor the GABA receptor theory GABA short for gammaamino butyric acid is a neurotransmitter a substance that governs how electrical signals pass between cells
    - Serpentine mu opioid receptor Image courtesy of Van Warren Receptor World
    - There are some scientists says Fields who think alcohol is addicting primarily through a direct action on GABA receptors that indirectly activates dopamine neurons Its true that alcohol does produce an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain where we know that feelings of reward originate And we know that rats bred to like alcohol will choose a lever to deliver alcohol directly into the region of their brains where there are dopamine neurons
    - Yet there is another principle at work that Fields finds equally fascinating It involves satiety or more accurately the failure of satiety to literally signal enough is enough
    - When we eat we eventually get full and eating is no longer pleasant Thats the satiety mechanism at work What if alcoholism is a failure of satiety What if alcoholics keep drinking because they never feel like theyve had enough Maybe alcohol is handled a lot like food
    - Animal models reveal that endorphins acting at the mu subtype of opioid receptor promote eating and suppress satiety Conversely endorphins activating the kappa receptor promote satiety So what about the endorphins released in the brain when someone drinks alcohol Where do they go
    - Thats what Fields and his colleagues are trying to nail down Questions abound Are there equal numbers of receptors he asks Do different endogenous opioids act on mu and kappa receptors Is the balance between a mu receptor that promotes drinking and a kappa receptor that suppresses drinking at least partially responsible for how much you drink
    - The answers might finally pinpoint where exactly alcohol acts to produce its powerful sense of reward That region or the molecular activity within it then becomes a potential drug target In Fields mind it boils down to this What were doing in my lab is using animals to find out what would be the ideal combination of receptor agonists and antagonists to maximally reduce drinking then try to design a molecule that would have those properties
    - For now naltrexone remains one of the few drugs effective for treating alcohol addiction The operative word here is treat not cure Still if you ask law enforcement and probation officials in Butte County California what they think about naltrexone treatment for alcohol abusers particularly repeat offenders tempted to get behind the wheel again the answer would likely be applause Indeed the latest figures show a percent drop in recidivism among those required to take the drug
    - Naltrexone is effective says Fields It reduces the amount you will drink which means that for many people its the difference between two drinks and five drinks But getting people to stay on it is tough And it might not work for everyone maybe because it blocks both the delta and kappa receptors Activated kappa receptors suppress alcohol intake So if you block them like what some have done in animal studies you could be creating conditions where some people drink more while taking naltrexone instead of less
    - Another drug called rimonabant Acomplia now being sold in various European countries as an antiobesity drug also seems to reduce both cigarette smoking and alcohol intake although its increased risk of depression has made the US Food and Drug Administration wary Nonetheless if approved rimonabants offlabel use could rival its primary purpose
    - Fields wouldnt mind the competition Based on the research going on here and other places in the US and around the world I would say that in the next five to years addiction treatment is going to be markedly improved by the introduction of new pharmacological agents
    - But will it matter In part of Alcoholism Vice or Disease we will discuss why some in the treatment community still seem to favor the bootstrap over the pill bottle

    paragraphs: 
    - Howard Fields
    - And what is will power but just another manifestation of nerve cell activity
    - With this question in part one of Addiction Vice or Disease neuroscientist Howard Fields a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of UCSFs Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction tossed a torch onto the dry grass of behavioral modification Only time and the success or failure of new antiaddiction drugs will determine if such incendiary remarks will ignite renewed debate or just flame out
    - In the meantime Fields continues to fire away at the status quo
    - Most treatment programs for alcoholics dont use a lot of medication he says They use detoxification and cognitive behavioral transformation like the Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous AA This is fine Many people are helped but relapse is very common What Id like to see is more clinical research The biggest hurdle is that not everyone in the medical profession has yet to buy into the fact that addiction is really a disease of the nervous system Its exciting of course that all the science is inevitably going to lead to some new treatments some of which were mentioned in part two of Addiction Vice or Disease And I think that after one or two truly effective drugs come along peoples attitudes toward alcoholism will change just like they did about depression when antidepressants came out But he adds what good is a new medication if the treatment community doesnt want to use it
    - US officials destroying liquor at the Brownsville Customs House December PhotoThe Robert Runyon Photograph Collection courtesy of The Center for American History The University of Texas at Austin
    - So what to make of other studies confirming that TS therapy can be superior to cognitive behavioral therapy when total abstinence is the desired outcome Does this prove the case for moral fiber After all if some addicts can control the urge to abuse drugs or drink excessively without relying on any antiaddiction drugs isnt this a victory of the will
    - In short says Fields there are many in the treatment community who resist using medications Their rationalization Another drug is just another crutch
    - The Lips that Touch Liquor Shall Never Touch Mine sheet music PhotoAmerican Sheet Music collection US Library of Congress
    - Is their criticism fair Some would argue yes Since addiction is known to hijack the pleasure centers of the brain replacing this destructive high with an elevated some might say spiritual one puts personal rehabilitation rather than biomedical intervention at the center of the treatment universe
    - And there is evidence that this approach has merit at least for some For example a study of AA members revealed that those who were encouraged by fellow members to stop drinking were three times more likely to be abstinent after a year than those who received no support at all More interesting if the encouragement came from nonAA members the impact on abstinence was negligible
    - Does this mean that the vigilance and self awakening inherent in AAs Step therapy TS is a cure in itself No When it comes to addiction cure is a big and misleading word The brain simply learns to like addictive substances too much even filing away a menu of environmental triggers a street corner money a sound a smell to queue up the urge In short abstinence is a daily battle
    - So what to make of other studies confirming that TS therapy can be superior to cognitive behavioral therapy when total abstinence is the desired outcome Does this prove the case for moral fiber After all if some addicts can control the urge to abuse drugs or drink excessively without relying on any antiaddiction drugs isnt this a victory of the will
    - Fields ever the neuroscientist thinks not In my mind any change in behavior is secondary to a change in the brain Will power does exist but it is biologically based and can be influenced by drugs for better or worse If drugs can dissolve your will power it follows that other drugs can restore it Still as the TS study suggests something very human if as yet uncharted in the brain can contribute to sustained behavioral change
    - Dr Bob Smith left and Bill Wilson cofounders of AA
    - The same can be said of the criminal justice system Fields answers Effective does not always mean scientifically enlightened If your attitude is that addiction should be punished because some drugs are illegal and its a crime to take them thats one approach When you choose that approach you are also saying that people are moral individuals that people are responsible for their actions that if someone chooses to do something that society does not approve of then that person should be punished and that the punishment is a disincentive for other people to engage in the same behavior It works up to a point Look at Prohibition Rates of alcoholism went way down Theres no question that making some drugs illegal does discourage many people from taking them
    - The problem as Fields sees it is that criminalizing addiction is a half measure with a dead end If your attitude like mine is that addiction is an illness you dont put people in jail Instead you find ways to get them treated because you want to solve the problem not just reduce it
    - And on that last point alone all would agree

    - The same can be said of the criminal justice system Fields answers Effective does not always mean scientifically enlightened If your attitude is that addiction should be punished because some drugs are illegal and its a crime to take them thats one approach When you choose that approach you are also saying that people are moral individuals that people are responsible for their actions that if someone chooses to do something that society does not approve of then that person should be punished and that the punishment is a disincentive for other people to engage in the same behavior It works up to a point Look at Prohibition Rates of alcoholism went way down Theres no question that making some drugs illegal does discourage many people from taking them
    - The problem as Fields sees it is that criminalizing addiction is a half measure with a dead end If your attitude like mine is that addiction is an illness you dont put people in jail Instead you find ways to get them treated because you want to solve the problem not just reduce it
    - And on that last point alone all would agree

    title: Has Science Been Framed?
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - How do you like your science news Rich with details Short and snappy Visually engrossing like an episode of Nature Or dense with text and formulas
    - These are not idle questions to scientists and people like me who write about biomedical scientists and their work Everything from continued research funding to which textbooks local school districts buy depends on getting the answers right for each different audience we try to reach
    - Toss in the questionable actions of those who influence opinions by misrepresenting science and you can see how complicated the picture can become Worse it is not just one picture were dealing with here
    - We all have our own picture of biomedical science that we carry around in our heads
    - Science is fun Its hard Its interesting Its boring Its cool Its tedious Its irrelevant Or wake me up when you find a real cure for cancer
    - A second layer call it a value prism a network of reference points a perceptual screen or even a belief system further bends and shapes what you hear and tags it as true or false
    - In a crudely simple example a person who does not believe in evolution will not be swayed by Darwinian logic The antievolutionist operates in a particular frame of reference that selectively hears welcomes or rejects information that fits inside the frame Call it the scientific uncertainty frame
    - The fierce Darwinist on the other hand operates in a completely different frame and cannot or will not consider why marshaling and presenting irrefutable details arent enough
    - No wonder that with all the talk about science no one seems to be listening or at least listening to the same things
    - Thats why the current debate over whether scientists should or should not try to frame their messages to make them more relevant is devouring so much bandwidth in cyberspace
    - Framing as authors Matthew C Nisbet and Chris Mooney wrote in the April edition of Science makes information relevant to different audiences Some in the scientific community have been receptive to this message However many scientists retain the wellintentioned belief that if laypeople better understood technical complexities from news coverage their viewpoints would be more like scientists and controversy would subside
    - The authors respectfully argue that scientists should strategically avoid emphasizing the technical details of science when trying to defend it
    - Evolutionists for example should define evolution as a building block for medical advances This is the social progress frame
    - Word play aside I think Nisbet and Mooneys defendingscience frame is what has riled up so many Consider this blog post
    - I agree with my colleagues who have noted that it is wrong for scientists to suck up to the media or the public in any way that compromises the scientific framework for thinking about the natural world I disagree with assertions that on the whole casting false pearls before real swine is OK
    - Or this one which distinguishes the packaging of science that goes on in the classroom or in research project summaries for grant reviewers from the moreslickthanaccurate PR job for the general public
    - Within science there are errorcorrecting mechanisms through which the spin hype and other sins can be criticized What comparable checks and balances exist in television magazines pulpits and the other avenues through which science is disseminated See this is where I put on my physicist hat and say all this talk about framin is just that talk Its sociological blahdeedah
    - Others accept that Nisbet and Mooney have a point even if in doing so they also accept that the public is depressingly scientifically illiterate
    - Sad to say the decline in the number of science writers and reporters might make the entire media framing argument moot With less and less reporting about science the publics illiteracy will not be challenged and attitudes about important national and international issues from stem cell research to climate change will be influenced most by dissemblers flakes and flacks
    - That presumes of course that while scientists fret and feud about framing the battle will be lost Lets just say that I have too much faith in scientists to think that will happen They are an engaging dedicated lot and if they are ambitious or too singleminded well we all can benefit from their drive to succeed Thats my frame and Im hanging with it

    title: Is There an Electron in the House? A Conversation with Electron Kebebew
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Electron Kebebew
    - Naming a child can sometimes stamp a child
    - So is it any wonder what an Ethiopian electrical engineer had in mind when he named his son Electron
    - But while engineering may have been in the boys blood this youngest of five children with siblings named Positron Neutron Deutron and Proton grew up to have medicine in his heart
    - Now as a UCSF endocrine surgeon and a research scientist Electron Kebebew MD operates on both bodies and genes He has become well a force a man on the move someone who commands attention as he strides the hallways of UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion
    - When you have a name like Electron people notice you and they have expectations of you he says But by and large as I think back on my life my name has been a positive influence
    - Positivism is what the yearold Kebebew exudes And why not The former UCSF resident embodies the renewed benchtobedside spirit of todays medicine
    - Translational medicine is the term that best describes my life right now says Kebebew who has not one but two clinical trials underway at UCSFs Comprehensive Cancer Center One pivots around his research into the genetic signatures of endocrine tumors The second examines how to make aggressive thyroid cancer more responsive to treatment
    - Chemotherapy doesnt work for most patients with aggressive thyroid cancer Kebebew explains And radioiodine treatment doesnt work either because thyroid cancer cells dont capture iodine like normal thyroid cells do What were now testing is a diabetes drug called rosiglitazone which causes cancer cells to reexpress the gene that takes up iodine What is unique and exciting about the approach is that were not using cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer Were just retraining the cell to do something it has lost the ability to do
    - Were not billing this as a cure For most people it could just mean that their life is prolonged But in those patients where the response to radioiodine is complete across all tumor cells a cure is at least possible
    - Call it an engineers hunch but early results show that an eightweek dose of the drug restores iodine uptake in some patients While Kebebew maps out his next steps in that trial he also is recruiting patients for a diagnostic study
    - In about percent of cases we cant tell if the thyroid is cancerous or not so we end up operating on patients to get a diagnosis I have been doing genetic array studies to find out if we can identify biomarkers for nonmalignant tumors that would make diagnostic surgeries unnecessary Kebebew thinks hes on the right track He filed a patent on the biomarkers last year and has now recruited onequarter of the patients he needs to prove the tests worth
    - Worth is a good word to use too There are some diagnostic thyroid surgeries performed in the United States each year Throw in the cost of care and each one tallies about This is not counting the expense of the second operation should the first prove that cancer has taken root
    - The study is designed around predictive value we still need to prove that the biomarker test generates false negatives less than percent of the time All in all were probably about three years away from being able to use it to make clinical decisions assuming that everything works as we hope Kebebew adds flashing a confident smile
    - Others straddling the midline between research and the operating room might find smiles hard to come by Kebebew instead enjoys the handson problem solving
    - Watch out adrenal tumors another disease that can hide its cancerous nature from various scans Kebebew is developing biomarkers for you too thanks in part to a yearold UCSF Mount Zion tissue bank that has more than tumor samples stored
    - Its an ambitious agenda for a chemical engineering undergraduate who never planned on attending medical school let alone become a de facto spokesperson for a new kind of clinical research I think the NIH needs to better define and fund translational research so that it includes not only the kind of basic science that might be many years away from a clinical application but also the kind of basic research that has an immediate impact on patients
    - Kebebew understands of course that he is an anomaly But he makes no apologies for how he sees the problem Beneath the blue scrubs an engineer still plans and plots
    - I became a doctor because I wanted to be able to have a major impact on another persons life My engineers training has made me more analytical I think in terms of cause and effect
    - So far the effects have all been promising And if they stay that way we might all have a reason to remember Electron Kebebew for more than his highpowered name

    title: Breastfeeding, Brain Development and Chemical Poisons:&nbsp; Neuroscientist Michael Merzenich
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Michael Merzenich
    - In late April the results of a scientific study conducted on newborn rats at UCSF were announced online in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
    - UCSF press release
    - Theres nothing unusual in that of course UCSF scientists generate hundreds of articles every year But there was something critically important in this study that every parent needs to consider In short should some women with a genetic history that includes family developmental disorders such as language impairment or dyslexia or with male partners who have a similar genetic background breastfeed their babies
    - Senior author of the study Michael Merzenich PhD UCSF Francis A Sooy MD Chair in Otolaryngology member of UCSFs WM Keck Foundation Center for Integrative Neuroscience and a scientist who pioneered the concept of brain plasticity is quick to state that this study was only in rats
    - But he is equally quick to suggest that the results should add to our worry about how chemical poisons such as PCBs and PCBEs the latter are used primarily as fire retardants in our environment can scramble a developing brain and how the varying cognitive deficits we know as autism and Aspergers syndrome might be a consequence
    - Merzenich understands that he is treading on very thin ice The value and benefits of breastfeeding are wellknown And for a scientist to inject a disruptive theory into a maternal bonding experience is he admits presumptuous
    - Yet he is alarmed And he is not alone The Department of Health and Human Services has posted lengthy documents here and here on its website about the harmful effects of PCBs and PCBEs
    - So has Merzenich himself
    - With hundreds of thousands of tons of PBDEs chemical cousins of PCBs accumulating in the environment every year and with levels rising in human fat tissue it is very worrying to think that the levels of PCBs to which the laboratory rats were exposed proportionately equal the levels now being found in the breast milk of women all over the country Again studies in rats do not always correlate to effects in humans That is why Merzenich is urging the government and diseasefocused organizations to push harder for human studies
    - Because the breastfeeding question is so important we have created a minute recording of Merzenichs Science Caf interview and made it available through our podcast download site Other portions of the interview which covered everything from the aging brain to neural prostheses will be made available in the coming weeks

    - Merzenich Actually we delivered it in rats We attempted to simulate the levels that had been recorded in human females in American environments The consequence of adding the PCB poisoning to simulating what we believed to be the factors that are contributing to the onset of these developmental disorders autism and related disorders had devastating additional consequences So we saw brains that were more degraded in their organization developmentally in these rats than we have ever seen before The PCBs had a very powerful amplifying effect for these developmental catastrophes that we were producing in these little animal models It both degraded the normal development of the brain It basically frustrated the brain so that processes were very abnormal and the brain remained into adulthood in a very primitive underdeveloped state So there is no question that in these models that there was some powerful some amplification of what would be contributed by an inherited weakness and that you would expect this the agency of this poison to contribute to an increased risk in a genetically at risk individual for the onset of something worse and that could be the conversion of somebody that would otherwise be a child that would develop a milder impairment developing something like an autistic syndrome condition It should be pointed out that its not just if there is any validity to this scenario its not just the fact that PCBs and PBDEs accumulate in the environment
    - There is a second probable contributor to the problem and thats the increased rate of nursing and increased rate of duration of nursing in American populations So over the past years for very good reasons for the health of infants more and more mothers are nursing their babies We have gone from a nursing rate of about percent roughly a quarter of babies being nursed by their mothers to about percent The average duration that mothers nurse their infants now is about twice as great as it was years ago This is a positive and good and healthy thing The problem is that these chemicals are concentrated in breast milk at a level of about six fold as they are in regular body tissues Because they are concentrated in fat in a sense the mother is concentrating these poisons and delivering them in relatively high dose levels to infants
    - That is another way of saying that if this really is an agent thats contributing to the increased risk for these catastrophic developmental conditions then a mother that has inherited weakness probably should think about this possibility when thinking about breastfeeding her infant So all of the wonderful good and positive reasons for nursing your baby those are all real those are all terrific they are all for the good of the baby unequivocally Its very hard to speak against that or be discouraging about that but on the other hand there is the possibility that in nursing you actually increase the risk of a bad outcome in this respect

    - But he is equally quick to suggest that the results should add to our worry about how chemical poisons such as PCBs and PCBEs the latter are used primarily as fire retardants in our environment can scramble a developing brain and how the varying cognitive deficits we know as autism and Aspergers syndrome might be a consequence
    - Merzenich understands that he is treading on very thin ice The value and benefits of breastfeeding are wellknown And for a scientist to inject a disruptive theory into a maternal bonding experience is he admits presumptuous
    - Yet he is alarmed And he is not alone The Department of Health and Human Services has posted lengthy documents here and here on its website about the harmful effects of PCBs and PCBEs
    - So has Merzenich himself
    - With hundreds of thousands of tons of PBDEs chemical cousins of PCBs accumulating in the environment every year and with levels rising in human fat tissue it is very worrying to think that the levels of PCBs to which the laboratory rats were exposed proportionately equal the levels now being found in the breast milk of women all over the country Again studies in rats do not always correlate to effects in humans That is why Merzenich is urging the government and diseasefocused organizations to push harder for human studies
    - Because the breastfeeding question is so important we have created a minute recording of Merzenichs Science Caf interview and made it available through our podcast download site Other portions of the interview which covered everything from the aging brain to neural prostheses will be made available in the coming weeks

    - Podcast transcript
    - Jeff Miller Weve talked many times before about the impact of your work on the understanding of autism Now that we have that very scary result PCB study in rats Im wondering should we be doing anything different Should women stop breast feeding for example What are the implications of that work
    - Michael Merzenich First of all the study is in rats Ive been trying to encourage the Autism Foundation and others to pursue correlative studies in humans The Centers for Disease Control have been worried about these chemicals and their potential effects in the development of babies for a long time and since about or they have been issuing warnings about them both about PCBs and PBDEs Their concern has been primarily about women exposed to these chemicals in areas where they are known to be in relatively high concentrations but in general our study adds to the worry and it really indicates that its in the great public interest to determine quickly whether or not these chemical poisons which are very widespread in the American environment in the world environments are adding to the risk of onset of these developmental disorders Because if they are this is a big thing Actually especially in the case of PBDEs I should say that the PCB is a double ring organic compound and C stands for chlorine Its a chlorinated compound and there is another family of closely related compounds in which the ring structures are brominated and not chlorinated Those are the PBDEs They are still being produced in the hundreds of thousands of tons as fire retardant chemicals and we know that the PBDEs have been growing and increasing in concentration in American females and in their milk doubling every two to five years So they are still very rapidly increasing in concentration and actually the concentration is equal or past the level of concentration of PCBs
    - Miller Now PCBs if I remember correctly have been banned since the late s
    - Merzenich Right
    - Miller And the PBDEs continue to be produced as you just mentioned
    - Merzenich Even though the PCBs were banned there was a large quantity produced and its out there in the environment and its very very slowly degraded And it actually accumulates in animal tissue and its basically lipidophilic so its concentrated in animal fat and it basically has been growing in concentration Concentration has increased up until recently even though it was banned a long time ago because it gradually accumulates and in mammals its very very difficult to get rid of it Its not broken down effectively in the body so it accumulates slowly increasing in concentration across the life span in humansonly relatively recently levels of PCBs recorded in human tissue in the US have been going down but at the same time as they go down the PBDEs go up
    - Miller Do they work in tandem in some fashion
    - Mrezenich Well we dont really know too much about the biological impacts of the brominated family of compounds They have been very little studied Chemically and structurally they are very very similar to a sub family of the PCBEs and its reasonable to believe that they have similar effects Again the Centers for Disease Control have been worried about them for a while because there has been evidence growing that they have effects in child development So we chose the particular PCB for study in part because they are very structurally similar to these PBDEs even though there is also a relatively high concentration in the environment as well
    - Miller Is there any way that we can protect ourselves since these compounds are so ubiquitous
    - Merzenich Well its a problem especially in the case of PBDEs because they are still being produced and released into the environment The governments in the US and more aggressively recently in the rest of the world especially in Europe and in Japan have been trying to encourage industry to substitute In some places in Europe they have been banned for a while and now there is a European Union wide move to eliminate the release of PBDEs There has been a growing movement to try to replace these fire retardant chemicals the PBDEs with something that is not so likely to be so biologically active That is occurring slowly in products that have been produced in Japan in the United States and in Europe In part its driven by the fear of the producers of these chemicals for the ultimate consequences of being held accountable for their massive release into human environments
    - Miller And what would be the association between the damage seen in rats and the potential damage seen in embryonic development of humans
    - Merzenich Actually we delivered it in rats We attempted to simulate the levels that had been recorded in human females in American environments The consequence of adding the PCB poisoning to simulating what we believed to be the factors that are contributing to the onset of these developmental disorders autism and related disorders had devastating additional consequences So we saw brains that were more degraded in their organization developmentally in these rats than we have ever seen before The PCBs had a very powerful amplifying effect for these developmental catastrophes that we were producing in these little animal models It both degraded the normal development of the brain It basically frustrated the brain so that processes were very abnormal and the brain remained into adulthood in a very primitive underdeveloped state So there is no question that in these models that there was some powerful some amplification of what would be contributed by an inherited weakness and that you would expect this the agency of this poison to contribute to an increased risk in a genetically at risk individual for the onset of something worse and that could be the conversion of somebody that would otherwise be a child that would develop a milder impairment developing something like an autistic syndrome condition It should be pointed out that its not just if there is any validity to this scenario its not just the fact that PCBs and PBDEs accumulate in the environment
    - There is a second probable contributor to the problem and thats the increased rate of nursing and increased rate of duration of nursing in American populations So over the past years for very good reasons for the health of infants more and more mothers are nursing their babies We have gone from a nursing rate of about percent roughly a quarter of babies being nursed by their mothers to about percent The average duration that mothers nurse their infants now is about twice as great as it was years ago This is a positive and good and healthy thing The problem is that these chemicals are concentrated in breast milk at a level of about six fold as they are in regular body tissues Because they are concentrated in fat in a sense the mother is concentrating these poisons and delivering them in relatively high dose levels to infants
    - That is another way of saying that if this really is an agent thats contributing to the increased risk for these catastrophic developmental conditions then a mother that has inherited weakness probably should think about this possibility when thinking about breastfeeding her infant So all of the wonderful good and positive reasons for nursing your baby those are all real those are all terrific they are all for the good of the baby unequivocally Its very hard to speak against that or be discouraging about that but on the other hand there is the possibility that in nursing you actually increase the risk of a bad outcome in this respect
    - Miller How would a mother know whether or not she has an inherent weakness
    - Merzenich Well its a problem and I think whats going to happen well first of all you know that you have an inherent weakness potentially because there is autism or developmental disorder in your family So if your family has a history of language impairment or of dyslexia or of autism itself those would certainly be indications that you probably have or the husband it can come from either side or both it would be an indication that there is some reason for concern Maybe genetic screening on some level is called for genetic counseling is called for for the parents in such a case
    - Miller Have you shared this opinion have you spoken out about it or written about it and then been confronted by those who feel that this is an attack on breast feeding
    - Merzenich Ive tried to be precautious about it but on the other hand what do you do when you have a hot potato like this in your hands I mean on the one hand you dont want to be an alarmist on the level which it can cause or going to result in an exaggerated and ultimately destructive response Because we know there is a lot of powerful evidence about the healthful benefits the good and positive benefits of child development for breast feeding not to mention the attachment of the mother with the infant and all these other wonderful and positive things that are associated with it It is absolutely with great trepidation and with substantial reservation that I discuss the potential role of breastfeeding Remember that this is a rat study and basically on the basis of the study alone giving any kind of advice to a mother or a pregnant woman about whether or not they should nurse their baby is very presumptuous Really what these studies strongly indicate is that they again raise a caution a red flag a warning and what weve tried to argue is that we know to little to be sure about it But this unequivocally raises a concern a concern that we hope will be aggressively addressed by other scientists and by the government Ultimately it might mean that you might not want to just know whether or not you have genetic risk for the origin of something like autism but you might want to know your PCB and PBDE levels in your blood and in your mouth and it might be of great interest to a young mother
    - Miller And are those tests are readily available
    - Merzenich No they are not readily available and this is one of the problems I think they will become more readily available and right now its a scramble and a struggle Its not that these measurements are so difficult to make The government in fact is monitoring the concentration of these chemicals in areas in which they believe individuals are at risk In various ways looking epidemiologically trying to get the ultimate consequences in human populations of there being high levels of these concentrations in breast milk and in blood Its still very piecemeal and fractionated and its not something that is easily and readily available for the average mom

    title: "Why Old Brains Never Die: A Conversation with UCSF Neuroscientist Michael Merzenich"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Michael Merzenich
    - An old brain is in constant need of a tuneup Thats the message from famed UCSF neuroscientist Michael Merzenich PhD who is featured in the May edition of Science Caf and in this latest installment His work on brain plasticity is also the subject of a cover story in the May edition of Discover magazine
    - Why the blanket coverage Well it could be that Merzenichs message resonates with baby boomers worried about the growing number of socalled senior moments stacking up like old newspapers
    - The good news says Merzenich is that the brain is plastic until you die That means you can count on it staying vibrant and alert if you stoke its electric engine with novelty and challenge Learning a new language is just one of many examples he cites
    - The goal says Merzenich is to drive our aging and less efficient brains in a positive and corrective direction Dont rest on your laurels he tell us And he adds quit complaining and buck up
    - How to do that is the subject of the second part of my interview with the UCSF Francis A Sooy MD Chair in Otolaryngology and member of UCSFs WM Keck Foundation Center for Integrative Neuroscience
    - Science literacy rests at least in part on storytelling skills And as discussed in a skillful piece on personality by Benedict Carey in the May edition of the New York Times it is the narrative that teases the brain into awareness With that in mind we should note that Englands Royal Society General Prize for Science Books has this year gone to Daniel Gilberts Stumbling on Happiness
    - A summary from the BBC World News article on the prizewinners describes Gilberts book as follows
    - Psychologist Daniel Gilbert reveals how and why the majority of us have no idea how to make ourselves happy The drive for happiness is one of the most instinctive and fundamental human impulses In this revealing and witty investigation psychologist Daniel Gilbert uses scientific research philosophy and reallife case studies to illustrate how our basic drive to satisfy our desires can not only be misguided but also intrinsically linked to some longstanding and contentious questions about human nature
    - Other titles on the short list for General Prize include
    - Titles on the short list for Junior Prize include
    - The full article can be found at the BBC World Service News site And if you happen to like lists as much as I do you might be interested in the biology section of Science Channels Greatest Discoveries based on a series that ran several years ago
    - Curious about their choice for number one The prize went to Anton van Leeuwenhoek for his accidental discovery of microorganisms in a water drop While Copernicus and Galileo and others are rightly praised for their observations and discoveries about the external universe van Leeuwenhoeks supremely serendipitous stumble into the inner world in opened doors that he could not have imagined and we have never looked back
    - Looking back and looking forward we want you to help us shape the future of Science Caf as we close in on month nine of its existence A reader survey will soon be incorporated into these pages And as always we welcome email comments and questions

    title: Voigt Makes Synthetic Biology Come Alive
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Christopher Voigt
    - You dont need a hard hat in Christopher Voigts lab at UCSF Mission Bay But dont be fooled This is a design and construction zone with renderings and circuit grids just like any other Only these plans are alive Literally And what they produce could change everything from how we treat disease to how we clean up toxic waste
    - Im in awe of biological systems says Voigt an assistant professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the School of Pharmacy and member of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research Even simple systems are so integrated and refined
    - Yet awestruck does not mean dumbstruck Voigt is a chemical engineer with a PhD degree in biochemistry and biophysics As such he has an irresistible urge to peek behind the curtain tinker in lifes workshop and find out what makes things work and how this part and that part can be fitted elsewhere to create something entirely new and useful
    - The results Something commonly known as synthetic biology made up of what Voigt calls toy systems Examples from Voigts workbench would include bacteria that take pictures a kind of living lithography or align into a sharp edge The principles that emerge from the toy systems can then be applied to biotechnological applications such as making spider thread by the yard or targeting tumors Its all part of his plan to develop a basis by which cells can be programmed like robots to perform complex coordinated tasks for pharmaceutical and industrial applications
    - We construct living systems that might not be at all what nature does Voigt says but they satisfy our need to put things together in a particular way to do what we want just like genetic robots Of course understanding first how biology solves a problem is important to understanding the pieces you expect to put together what kind of computations you expect a cell to perform and how they are rewired in different contexts
    - You also need to know which pieces of DNA transfer easily between species Bacteria frequently exchange pieces of DNA with their environment So for example if there is a piece thats been integrated and swapped many times between organisms then that implies that were going to be able to put it into our host and have it function in a way that is modular and robust
    - What are some of these modular elements Well bacteria react to stimuli they have sensors and circuits that can be manipulated Bacteria such as salmonella also have a secretion system to get their poisonous proteins into human cells So why not rewire the system connect it to an improved version of a spiders finicky webgenerating machine and then use it to essentially farm and harvest spider fibrils instead fibrils that are times stronger than Kevlar and biodegradable to boot
    - Consider that image for a moment a spider silk spinning out of vats of bacteria
    - That should be patented dont you think Voigt who when not assembling Legos or drawing pictures as a kid was taking apart and rebuilding old television sets forms a yeswevetakencareofthat smile and moves on
    - Some people dismiss what were doing as parlor tricks but there is always an underlying design principle were testing he says These principles usually take shape in Voigts mind a place where art meets calculus From the beginning Im interested in how you will display the information you get from an experiment How do you make a particular point come across If I end up with something that cant be visualized or easily explained then I dont go down that path
    - Not that Voigt confuses ease with easy The output might be visual and accessible but his focus is as he says on the innards When we did the bacterial photography we needed to create a new light sensor We also had to perform some metabolic engineering to create the sensor There were also genetic circuits that had to be constructed and it required about bases of designed DNA So while the public saw the little pictures in the petri dish and got excited by that our deeper goal was to learn how refined a DNA function we could construct and control
    - At this point one expects to hear the playing God question so I ask it Interestingly Voigt says journalists are usually the only ones who raise the issue these days The public he speaks to seems to understand that these techniques can be used to solve problems in society from making stronger biodegradable materials to converting us from a petroleumbased economy They also recognize that it is OK to pursue an idea that doesnt necessarily tell you anything new about biology
    - Living photograph Scientists at UCSF and U of Texas have been creating living photographs by genetically engineered microbes to become biological film Bacteria exposed to light produce dark pigment while those in the dark do not PhotoAaron Chevalier UTAustin
    - The irony is that in doing so Voigt has evolved into the design engineer he dreamed of becoming as an eager high school student before learning in college that such a specialty did not exist The best analogy is one that Voigt uses for his own tailored biological creations Airplanes fly but theyre not birds A different set of design principles leads to the same end
    - Such flexibility says something wonderful about Voigts version of modern science Genomic discovery has put a lot of new ground under sciences big top and while I hesitate to call what is happening in labs around UCSF a threering circus there is some truth in the image There is a lot of juggling and highwire acrobatics as information pushes forward from the wings clamoring to become knowledge Inspired performance is the norm and as a synthetic biologist Voigt is one of a new breed of ringmasters How well he manages this parade could go a long way toward determining whether his branch of science will be center pole or sideshow

    - Living photograph Scientists at UCSF and U of Texas have been creating living photographs by genetically engineered microbes to become biological film Bacteria exposed to light produce dark pigment while those in the dark do not PhotoAaron Chevalier UTAustin
    - The irony is that in doing so Voigt has evolved into the design engineer he dreamed of becoming as an eager high school student before learning in college that such a specialty did not exist The best analogy is one that Voigt uses for his own tailored biological creations Airplanes fly but theyre not birds A different set of design principles leads to the same end
    - Such flexibility says something wonderful about Voigts version of modern science Genomic discovery has put a lot of new ground under sciences big top and while I hesitate to call what is happening in labs around UCSF a threering circus there is some truth in the image There is a lot of juggling and highwire acrobatics as information pushes forward from the wings clamoring to become knowledge Inspired performance is the norm and as a synthetic biologist Voigt is one of a new breed of ringmasters How well he manages this parade could go a long way toward determining whether his branch of science will be center pole or sideshow

    paragraphs: 
    - Keith Yamamoto UCSFs executive vice dean for research in the School of Medicine began his UCSF career in Among scientists he is probably best known for his discoveries about the nature and function of steroid receptors And while it is now widely understood that these receptors located inside a cell are responsible for influencing the action of genes in almost every major organ system in the body how that happens was a complete mystery when Yamamotos research began
    - It is much less of a mystery now in this new age of genome sequencing But when it comes to finding the right steps in the complicated dance of cell receptors and genes knowing the moves does not always mean you have mastered the performance What is true of an individual lab is true of science in general That explains why choreographing experiments to help us understand everything from aging to asthma can produce a confusing mix of adagio and allegro more generally known in the scientific world as stops and starts
    - Yamamoto has seen a lot of stops and starts in his many years at UCSF And in the video interview that follows he shares his thoughts opinions and dreams about science and why the race to the future has already started
    - Inflammation cancer the brain stem cells metabolism developmental biology the whole world of biomedical science at UCSF is finding new connections and a new universality Next on the list How about a melding of training programs for PhDs and MDs
    - See video
    - From stem cells to cancer therapies the public is frequently asked to make many complex decisions about the implications of science this at a time when newspaper and related coverage is declining Should scientists themselves help fill the communication gap Or should the public be responsible And is biomedical science a tough sell
    - See video
    - A mere two to three decades ago basic scientists celebrated serendipitous discovery and shunned targeted science Yet with the advent of translational science basic scientists are rushing to be leaders in the field What happened And was it more a change of attitude or a change in technology that paved the way

    - If you watched the video segment on Communicating Science in last weeks interview with Keith Yamamoto UCSF and the Future of Science you already know his views on the responsibility of scientists to explain and excite the public about their work
    - Part of that communication of course is web communication Now we all realize that research laboratory websites are not usually designed for public consumption More often than not they are clubby targeted to their scientific peers not the lay audience
    - And maybe thats appropriate in one sense the strict sense But the web connects UCSF to the world and we should use that opportunity to talk plainly and persuasively to those nonscientists in the global audience who might be curious about life sciences research You never know One of them might want to send a donation
    - Would they know where to send it Not always Few of the science sites at UCSF carry the official UCSF web banner And in some cases UCSF is not even mentioned on the front page a kind of missed communication
    - So as part of what we will now call the Yamamoto Challenge Science Caf is announcing a website contest with a prize of to the winning laboratory center or institute as the case might be
    - The contest judged by representatives of the UCSF Department of Public Affairs will evaluate research center scientific institute or program and laboratory websites on the ucsfedu domain in four major areas
    - The contest judging will begin the week of July The winning site will be announced and showcased on the main UCSF web page in midSeptember If there are sites you would like to nominate please do so via the Science Caf email
    - Speaking of contests Seed magazine is conducting its second annual science writing contest
    - This years topic What does it mean to be scientifically literate in the st century How do we measure the scientific literacy of a society How do we boost it What is the value of this literacy Who is responsible for fostering it
    - Essay submissions will be judged by a panel of Seed editors and special guests Winning entries will be published in Seed magazine
    - He might not get a monetary prize for his work but Science Caf alumnus Ken Dill PhD professor of biophysics and pharmaceutical chemistry at UCSF and associate dean of research in the School of Pharmacy see Bring Back the Ivory Tower Part Bring Back the Ivory Tower Part has earned a bow after working with his graduate student Justin Bradford to develop a model that answers the question What were the prelife steps that caused the earliest chemicals to come together setting the stage for metabolism or RNA machinery You can read the full news release here
    - Speaking of another Science Caf alum Voelker Doetsch see German Science Stirs With a UCSF Spin Part German Science Stirs With a UCSF Spin Part I was reminded of my conversation about the surge in German science while reading Alison Abbots feature Science in Germany A Beacon of Reform in the June issue of Nature In short Abbot uses the example of the Charit Medical School in Berlin to describe how changes in funding and attitude have invigorated the yearold institution Quoted in the article is a former UCSF postdoc from Roger Nicolls lab Dietmar Schmitz who returned to Germany in lured back in part by a statesponsored incentive program for migr scientists Id be a liar if I said the atmosphere here was quite the same as San Francisco and Berkeley but there is already a huge difference compared with when I studied here in the mids says the Charit neuroscientist Its getting there slowly

    title: Can Addiction Be Stopped? Banys Responds to Fields
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Peter Banys
    - Editors Note In a recent threepart series Alcoholism Vice or Disease part part part neuroscientist Howard Fields MD PhD a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of the Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction tabbed the brains lack of impulsivity control not lack of willpower as a central cause of addiction Peter Banys MD director of the substance abuse clinic at the UCSFaffiliated San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and a clinical professor in the UCSF Department of Psychiatry now responds with a different perspective on the promise of research and the mystery of recovery
    - I enjoyed Howard Fields recent threepart review of the neuroscience of alcoholism I too believe that in the near future we will have more effective pharmacological interventions for the alcoholisms
    - Why do I use the plural Because alcoholism like so many seemingly unitary diseases in the past such as leukemia is better conceptualized as a group of final commonpathway disorders with diverse genetic drivers different biochemical anomalies and different responses to interventions
    - We will soon be speaking of the alcoholisms
    - As my friends at the Gallo Center know only too well there is certainly going to be a large family of alcoholism disorders with genetic differences The national Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism COGA has identified many gene loci implicated not only in alcohol consumption but in related phenomena such as impulsivity or sensation seeking
    - Decades of clinical work attempting to phenotype alcoholics into behavioral categories maintenance binge periodic or character structures impulsive dogmatic passive or age of onset early adult late onset have mostly failed to show improvement in matching patients to treatments
    - In my opinion genotyping will lead to better medication matching than phenotyping The goal is to identify one or more subtypes that respond to one or more medications For example patients who respond to naltrexone an opiate blocker for alcohol relapse prevention may just have a genetic variant in the mu opiate receptor I hope for a simple genetic blood test that might be correlated with a good response to naltrexone
    - Having said that to date most medications for alcoholism including naltrexone and the European drug acamprosate tend to wash out in largescale controlled trials maybe just maybe because we still cant parse alcoholism into workable subcategories The awkward truth about approved medications for alcoholism is that a effect sizes tend to be small and b longterm compliance is exceedingly poor
    - Enter two cautionary tales We already have two drugs Antabuse and naltrexone in the pharmacy that ought to be perfect interventions for alcoholism and for opiate addiction Antabuse disulfiram was discovered independently in Ohio and Denmark in the s It blocks an enzyme in alcohol metabolism and causes a nauseating rise in acetaldehyde as an intermediate product It reliably makes most people seriously nauseated when they consume even a small amount of alcohol And it is effective for five to seven days after the last daily dose
    - Yet largescale studies cannot prove it more effective than placebo and it seems to work only when both legally mandated and compliancemonitored
    - Naltrexone is a powerful mu opiate blocker and virtually no opiate on earth can override its longacting blockade Anyone taking it is simply wasting his or her time attempting to get an effect from injected heroin
    - It should be capable of halting the heroin epidemic in its tracks but it isnt
    - In this country the only subgroups that do well on it are medical professionals whose licenses are held hostage to compliance The gold standard for heroin treatment comes from a different angle It is methadone a longacting noninjectable opiate replacement or more recently buprenorphine a partial opiate agonist
    - What about targeting craving Everyone talks about craving as if it were a reliable precursor to drinking or using It is not many relapses occur much like a lightning strike on a clear day that is without warning Craving is one of those concepts that everyone uses and thinks they understand until they settle down to measure it at which point it starts to trickle through their fingers
    - There is a large and unsatisfying literature on craving something actually very hard to measure and of only limited importance in relapse In my clinical opinion Fields is right to focus on deep reward mechanisms in the brain even harder to measure but probably the key mechanism to addiction So far the drugs we have a only work for some but not all alcoholics and b have unclear impacts on craving They probably work when they do on more basic rewardpayoff mechanisms deep in the brain
    - Craving is a more important concept in addiction to stimulants cocaine and methamphetamine and opiates This I think is because there is a more simple almost Pavlovian conditioned response going on
    - A major part of treatment for stimulant addicts is in relapse prevention often consisting of careful cue identification and avoidance I had a patient who had profound cocaine craving at one particular intersection in the Mission District near a coffee shop in which he purchased drugs The intervention was not to desensitize him or talk him out of it It was instead to avoid driving through the neighborhood Expose a cocaine addict in recovery to a crystalline white powder and interesting things happen on functional brain imaging
    - There is no a priori reason why some medications might not reduce craving but more fundamental mechanisms will likely be found Craving is simply insufficient as a lone concept to understand why someone can suddenly relapse as a veteran I see just did after more than eight years of sobriety He had no craving to warn him It just seemed right to accept a drink after all this time
    - What remains the Holy Grail of all this research It is to find fundamental reward mechanisms that can be so modified by medication that alcohol returns to being a mere beverage as it is for nine out of American men For a brief shining moment we thought we had it in naltrexone We thought we had found the opiate reward hidden deep inside the alcoholic drinking Then a large multisite placebocontrolled trial in the VA Krystal et al New England Journal of Medicine dashed that overly simple hope
    - What about recovery the psychological side of the equation I do think that recovery remains in great measure a psychological process of coming to terms with ones problem be that personal weakness human frailty or whatever we choose to call it It takes time and outside help
    - Books have been written about recovery But what is essential is that most people cannot do it on their own they have tried for decades to control themselves and failed Recovery starts when one person asks another for help In this respect this is an entirely human process although we can dress it up in various fancier kinds of language from Alcoholics Anonymous and sociology to psychiatry Recovery is not about willpower to be sure and it is also about more than neurochemistry
    - A career in addiction does a lot of damage to ones family and social nexus Recovery brings with it the inescapable confrontation with the damage one has done to others In this regard it shifts the work away from mere reward to entirely more complex questions such as what it takes to gain personal redemption and forgiveness from those who have been harmed It is why perhaps only the first step of AAs steps even mentions alcohol The rest are concerned with questions of personal integrity making amends and eventually helping others less fortunate along the way
    - Recovery is not as simple as the restitution of abstinence an abnormal condition for most Americans or the blockade of craving The mystery of recovery is that it necessarily faces one with questions of how one is to live a life of integrity
    - Biochemical and genetic progress is around the corner But the genetics of the alcoholisms will necessarily force clearer thinking about public policy lest we discover that our children are uninsurable due to genetic profiling of risks
    - I do agree with Fields that incarceration for addiction is a proven failure as public policy Over years of the war on drugs have taught us that This is why the passage of Proposition treatment rather than incarceration in was so important But California still has the highest drug incarceration rate in the nation and thus the world and we continue to jail more citizens for possession than we do for trafficking or manufacture Despite the temporary setback of Prop some in the powerful incarceration industry are still advocating two new prisons for California They know how to keep them filled

    - Why do I use the plural Because alcoholism like so many seemingly unitary diseases in the past such as leukemia is better conceptualized as a group of final commonpathway disorders with diverse genetic drivers different biochemical anomalies and different responses to interventions
    - We will soon be speaking of the alcoholisms
    - As my friends at the Gallo Center know only too well there is certainly going to be a large family of alcoholism disorders with genetic differences The national Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism COGA has identified many gene loci implicated not only in alcohol consumption but in related phenomena such as impulsivity or sensation seeking
    - Decades of clinical work attempting to phenotype alcoholics into behavioral categories maintenance binge periodic or character structures impulsive dogmatic passive or age of onset early adult late onset have mostly failed to show improvement in matching patients to treatments
    - In my opinion genotyping will lead to better medication matching than phenotyping The goal is to identify one or more subtypes that respond to one or more medications For example patients who respond to naltrexone an opiate blocker for alcohol relapse prevention may just have a genetic variant in the mu opiate receptor I hope for a simple genetic blood test that might be correlated with a good response to naltrexone
    - Having said that to date most medications for alcoholism including naltrexone and the European drug acamprosate tend to wash out in largescale controlled trials maybe just maybe because we still cant parse alcoholism into workable subcategories The awkward truth about approved medications for alcoholism is that a effect sizes tend to be small and b longterm compliance is exceedingly poor
    - Enter two cautionary tales We already have two drugs Antabuse and naltrexone in the pharmacy that ought to be perfect interventions for alcoholism and for opiate addiction Antabuse disulfiram was discovered independently in Ohio and Denmark in the s It blocks an enzyme in alcohol metabolism and causes a nauseating rise in acetaldehyde as an intermediate product It reliably makes most people seriously nauseated when they consume even a small amount of alcohol And it is effective for five to seven days after the last daily dose
    - Yet largescale studies cannot prove it more effective than placebo and it seems to work only when both legally mandated and compliancemonitored
    - Naltrexone is a powerful mu opiate blocker and virtually no opiate on earth can override its longacting blockade Anyone taking it is simply wasting his or her time attempting to get an effect from injected heroin
    - It should be capable of halting the heroin epidemic in its tracks but it isnt
    - In this country the only subgroups that do well on it are medical professionals whose licenses are held hostage to compliance The gold standard for heroin treatment comes from a different angle It is methadone a longacting noninjectable opiate replacement or more recently buprenorphine a partial opiate agonist
    - What about targeting craving Everyone talks about craving as if it were a reliable precursor to drinking or using It is not many relapses occur much like a lightning strike on a clear day that is without warning Craving is one of those concepts that everyone uses and thinks they understand until they settle down to measure it at which point it starts to trickle through their fingers
    - There is a large and unsatisfying literature on craving something actually very hard to measure and of only limited importance in relapse In my clinical opinion Fields is right to focus on deep reward mechanisms in the brain even harder to measure but probably the key mechanism to addiction So far the drugs we have a only work for some but not all alcoholics and b have unclear impacts on craving They probably work when they do on more basic rewardpayoff mechanisms deep in the brain
    - Craving is a more important concept in addiction to stimulants cocaine and methamphetamine and opiates This I think is because there is a more simple almost Pavlovian conditioned response going on
    - A major part of treatment for stimulant addicts is in relapse prevention often consisting of careful cue identification and avoidance I had a patient who had profound cocaine craving at one particular intersection in the Mission District near a coffee shop in which he purchased drugs The intervention was not to desensitize him or talk him out of it It was instead to avoid driving through the neighborhood Expose a cocaine addict in recovery to a crystalline white powder and interesting things happen on functional brain imaging
    - There is no a priori reason why some medications might not reduce craving but more fundamental mechanisms will likely be found Craving is simply insufficient as a lone concept to understand why someone can suddenly relapse as a veteran I see just did after more than eight years of sobriety He had no craving to warn him It just seemed right to accept a drink after all this time
    - What remains the Holy Grail of all this research It is to find fundamental reward mechanisms that can be so modified by medication that alcohol returns to being a mere beverage as it is for nine out of American men For a brief shining moment we thought we had it in naltrexone We thought we had found the opiate reward hidden deep inside the alcoholic drinking Then a large multisite placebocontrolled trial in the VA Krystal et al New England Journal of Medicine dashed that overly simple hope
    - What about recovery the psychological side of the equation I do think that recovery remains in great measure a psychological process of coming to terms with ones problem be that personal weakness human frailty or whatever we choose to call it It takes time and outside help
    - Books have been written about recovery But what is essential is that most people cannot do it on their own they have tried for decades to control themselves and failed Recovery starts when one person asks another for help In this respect this is an entirely human process although we can dress it up in various fancier kinds of language from Alcoholics Anonymous and sociology to psychiatry Recovery is not about willpower to be sure and it is also about more than neurochemistry
    - A career in addiction does a lot of damage to ones family and social nexus Recovery brings with it the inescapable confrontation with the damage one has done to others In this regard it shifts the work away from mere reward to entirely more complex questions such as what it takes to gain personal redemption and forgiveness from those who have been harmed It is why perhaps only the first step of AAs steps even mentions alcohol The rest are concerned with questions of personal integrity making amends and eventually helping others less fortunate along the way
    - Recovery is not as simple as the restitution of abstinence an abnormal condition for most Americans or the blockade of craving The mystery of recovery is that it necessarily faces one with questions of how one is to live a life of integrity
    - Biochemical and genetic progress is around the corner But the genetics of the alcoholisms will necessarily force clearer thinking about public policy lest we discover that our children are uninsurable due to genetic profiling of risks
    - I do agree with Fields that incarceration for addiction is a proven failure as public policy Over years of the war on drugs have taught us that This is why the passage of Proposition treatment rather than incarceration in was so important But California still has the highest drug incarceration rate in the nation and thus the world and we continue to jail more citizens for possession than we do for trafficking or manufacture Despite the temporary setback of Prop some in the powerful incarceration industry are still advocating two new prisons for California They know how to keep them filled

    - Podcast transcript
    - Jeff Miller Im here today with Mary Dallman an expert in the neural arrangements that define the effects of chronic stress on brain and body which is kind of a mouthful for saying that stress has both good and bad effects Mary could you tell me something about your research I know youve been at it for a long time and could you give me a summary of what youve been doing And what your findings have been over the years
    - Mary Dallman Well you have to know first that I fell in love with the glucocorticoids which are the adrenal stress hormones when I was in college And Ive never never stopped loving them and trying to find out what they do So much of what we do in the lab is trying to answer the question both for brain and body what the role of the glucocorticoids is with stress and particularly chronic stress
    - Miller Now these are in every cell type in the body correct
    - Dallman The glucocorticoid receptors are in every cell type in the body if not every cell
    - Miller So what have you learned about Youve said that youve been in love with them since college days so clearly there was some particular fascination about this as opposed to other avenues you could have pursued
    - Dallman I was a chemist and I loved their structure and then I became a physiologist and I adored the fact that they are protean hormones that do almost anything you want them to do They can make you fat they can make you thin all depending on the context in which the body is when they act They can make you learn they can make you forget They can make you eat a lot They can make you fight
    - Miller So lets go back to the fat and thin part since obesity is sort of the topic of the day How does that work
    - Dallman When the glucocorticoids are secreted and the animal I have to back up When animals are exposed to increasing amounts of glucocorticoids without any stress they become fat They lose muscle and they gain fat and more than that the fat is in the belly That is a very clear action of the glucocorticoids that requires increased insulin secretions as well Which they do However when the animals are stressed and only have chow to eat and glucocorticoids are varied in the same way the animals may get thin rather than fat because stress induces the action of the sympathetic nervous system And the sympathetic norepinephrine secretion melts fat in the presence of glucocorticoids
    - Miller So lets talk for a second about what exactly stress is I think a lot of people have some notion about how it feels to be under stress but what exactly is happening inside their bodies
    - Dallman Well if youre stressed and if youre challenged by something and cant get away from it and cant relieve it behaviorally or in some other fashion and if this persists then the brain changes and the stress input activates a limbic emotional brain to recruit pathways in the brain that alter behaviors alter neuroendocrine function alter autonomic function and basically alter the way the brain responds to various new stimuli In the body the elevated glucocorticoids secreted with stress decrease protein synthesis and increase fat synthesis and increase glucose synthesis all very sensible if you need to get away from stress But not so good if you cant get away from it
    - Miller So because of the energy stored in the fat because you might need to flee
    - Dallman Yes
    - Miller Because you might not be around regular food supplies or whatever
    - Dallman Exactly If you dont have stores for energy you cant move very far and die on your way
    - Miller So its a beneficial evolutionary response
    - Dallman Its marvelous evolutionarily because there hasnt been the enormous availability of corner food stores and McDonalds and endless inexpensive food that there is in our society
    - Miller So is that related to why these food centers in our brain tend to light up around sweets
    - Dallman Ah The glucocorticoids also make you enjoy things more such as sweet foods such as drugs such as fat foods And I think there is work now showing they generally act on the brain to make you want more of whatever is ongoing in the environment So if youve got a bucket of ice cream youll eat more of it if your glucocorticoids are high if you are going to be angry at somebody you will be more angry if the glucocorticoids are high
    - Miller Is it then since stress is evolutionarily beneficial that it is the inability to escape the stressor in modern life that seems to be one of the triggers
    - Dallman I think so yes Yes definitely You cant run away from a bad boss unless you change jobs and that has its own uncertainties
    - Miller The recent study that was reported in late June early July regarding the biology of fat into which you contributed a commentary for the journal Nature Medicine it suggests that maybe our biology is a mismatch for our current environment this highly stressed stuffyourface kind of world in which we live at least for many modern Americans Is that a fair assessment of that study
    - Dallman Yes I think so I think its a terrific study What it did for me was complete a loop that I didnt understand in our rat studies and that is that in the presence of highcarbohydrate highfat diet plus stress there is increased secretion of neuropeptide Y through the autonomic nervous system into fat depots and that increased neuropeptide Y secretion inhibits the actions of the catecholemines that are secreted also from the autonomics and increases fat cell proliferation and vascularization
    - Miller So lets break that down a little bit So neuropeptide Y actually controls the pathway that determines how many fat cells are made and how much fat is deposited
    - Dallman Yep Yep And its been known for a long time that neuropeptide Y and norepinephrine exist in the same neurons in the sympathetic nervous system And its also been known with low stimulation that norepinephrine is secreted but with high levels of stimulation of these sympathetic nerves you get secretion of both norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y This study by Zukowska and her coworkers showed that with high levels of intense stresses they got NPY secretion into the fat depots whereas with low levels of stress they did not
    - Miller So this is mice
    - Dallman This is mice
    - Miller Ok Again just so that were clear Mice under stress Id like you to describe the kind of stress that they put the mice under were fed a highsugary diet
    - Dallman Highsugary and highfat
    - Miller Highfat And then there were mice fed a similar diet who were not similarly stressed
    - Dallman Thats correct And then there were two more groups of mice who were fed only chow And only the mice who had highfat diet increased their fat depots but strikingly the mice that had highfat highsugar diet and stress intense stress got fatter than the animals that only had the pleasurable diet
    - Miller So describe the kind of stress that the mice were put under so that people really can understand how this heat might equate to their workplace environment
    - Dallman laughs Well the mice who did respond in this way to stress were stressed with standing in cold water ice cold water for an hour a day for days or they were stressed by being ha social subordinates and were threatened heavily by social dominant mice Now that you could directly relate to the workplace
    - Miller laughs How much time were they exposed to this stress
    - Dallman For an hour a day
    - Miller Not eight hours
    - Dallman Not eight hours Just one However I suspect most people who are heavily stressed by the workplace are not exposed to their bosses for eight hours a day too
    - Miller So this is in mice
    - Dallman This is in mice But I also want to say that two other stresses did not produce the same effect
    - Miller These were
    - Dallman These were much lower intensity They were either being put in a tube where they couldnt get out for an hour a day or they were standing on a platform above water but not in cold water for an hour a day
    - Miller So what does that subtle difference say about the triggering mechanism
    - Dallman I think it says you really have to push the sympathetic neurons to fat to cause NPY secretion plus norepinephrine secretion rather than just norepinephrine
    - Miller So again mice as they relate to humans many findings in mice do not always translate exactly or even closely to humans So what type of things might be fundamentally different and not work in humans should this ever get to a clinical trial phase in humans
    - Dallman Well first they have to solve the problem I think we havent said that the group found that the neuropeptide Y was acting through specifically Y receptors in the fat depots both on fat cells and the blood vessels to cause proliferation These receptors do exist in people and in peoples fat cells and in their blood vessels but theres a whole host of neuropeptide Y receptors in people and in mice and the ratio of the receptors may be different in people than they are in mice Thats one possibility So that you might not have the same effects of infusing Y receptor sector antagonists which is what the Zukowska group showed was so effective in blocking the fat formation in stressed animals
    - MillerAnything else that comes to mind
    - Dallman Delivery of the drug I think is going to be a really tricky proposition
    - Miller Im glad you brought that up because what Ive read about it says that theyre interested in licensing the technology So is there anything that you know about the specifics of this Is it licensable
    - Dallman No but I dont know what represents licensable I mean patents or licensing is something that I am completely unfamiliar with
    - Miller There was some talk too about reconstructive and cosmetic possibilities for this technology What do you think about that
    - Dallman Well what I gather is that rather than infuse an antagonist to the Y receptor they plan to infuse NPY and they have shown that if they do infuse NPY they can increase in mice the fat depot
    - Miller I have to ask too You know this American penchant for the magic bullet and clearly these results could be achieved by diet and exercise the old standbys Is even the prospect of something like this a bad thing do you suppose psychologically for the American people as we confront this obesity epidemic
    - Dallman Yeah I think its a lousy idea actually because it doesnt change the head at all It may change if it works the prospect for ultimate metabolic health but really what you need to do with a chronic inescapable stressor is to figure a way of dealing with it And even if its inescapable you can put your head in another place and perhaps meditate or perhaps read a book and get away from it enough so that you gain more perspective
    - Miller And I guess if you think about the negative effects actually accumulating to the point where it drove you to do something about it if there were no such negative effects than perhaps you would persist in a situation that was otherwise not healthy for you
    - Dallman Absolutely Absolutely It takes energy to get away from it but its worth the energy to revise your head to the extent that you can deal with the stressor
    - Miller I want to circle back one second to this idea about mice and humans because Im wondering would there ever be do you suppose if this type of approach did work in humans genetic profiles that would make it more likely to help one group over another I mean is that a possibility
    - Dallman Sure Absolutely its a possibility
    - Miller Again because of the variation in neuropeptide receptors
    - Dallman In the receptors and actually one of the interesting things about the Y receptors which are the ones that are important for accumulation of fat is that there has been a genetics study in mice showing that Y receptors associate very very strongly with mesenteric or intraabdominal fat which is the kind of fat that has been shown to be worst for us in terms of outcome
    - Miller This is all part of that metabolic syndrome
    - Dallman Yes it is part of the metabolic syndrome
    - Miller With the associated high cholesterol high blood pressure early diabetes all of those things
    - Dallman And also the paper in Nature Medicine by Zukowska showed that they had metabolic syndromelike effects with the chronic stress and the highcalorie diet
    - Miller So would you view this paper as a milestone in this area of research
    - Dallman I think its very important just because theyve connected what happens in the head with what happens in the fat in people who can eat ad lib or potentially connected that
    - Miller I know youve had a very long career
    - Dallman laughs
    - Miller So was that connection at all obvious or respected as a possibility when you began I wont say how many years ago
    - Dallman Actually longer than that No it was not expected and
    - Miller Or respected
    - Dallman Respected Lord no No thats one of the wonderful things thats happening and I think probably through human scanning MRI and pet studies where its becoming quite clear that the head runs the body and what happens in the head very very much determines how the body responds to various things
    - Miller A once very radical notion
    - Dallman A once highly radical notion
    - Miller Well lets talk about your latest work and what avenues you might be pursuing these days
    - Dallman Well one of the things weve been focusing on for the last year or so has been pursuing a finding that came up a couple of years ago in the lab which showed that increased glucocortociods caused increased lard eating absolutely in proportion Rats were given chow to eat and a bucket of lard separately And it turns out
    - Miller Im grimacing here
    - Dallman laughs You are grimacing It turns out that rats will just snarf down the lard Rat chow is exceedingly boring and is pretty low fat And rats like fat So with a separate bucket of lard the rats will nibble at the lard and theyll compose diets that are about And as you increase glucocorticoids theyll go up higher and higher in their lard ingestion theyll go up to But we did a study in which we made the rats diabetics so they had no insulin And all of a sudden the glucocorticoids had no effect on lard eating at all And unlike that they finally had an effect on the amount of chow that was eaten So in the absence of insulin the glucocorticoids increased chow eating in the presence of insulin the glucocorticoids increased lard eating That was absolutely clear but we were wondering why and how Or where And so in the first studies for other reasons the vagus nerve from the liver to the brain was cut And that also induced lard eating in the animals that had no insulin And we felt that we really had to pursue this and find out where the insulin was acting or how to cause lard eating in animals that otherwise had no insulin
    - Miller And what have you found
    - Dallman And what weve done is cut all kinds of vagus as well as stopped the afferent traffic from the liver to the brain and it turns that its the signal from liver to brain that normally when theres no insulin around inhibits the intake of fat And thats as far as weve gotten on that except that we have clear evidence that when lard is eaten by rats the brain pleasure centers turn on and that probably explains why the glucocorticoids are so important in this because they seem to turn on the pleasure center and through that mechanism cause many different behaviors
    - Miller In the end it always comes back to pleasure doesnt it
    - Dallman It does Reward is good
    - Miller Before I let you go I must ask you one last question and that is you have been alternately referred to as a neuroscientist and a physiologist and Im just wondering how do you see yourself so that we can properly label you
    - Dallman laughs I dont like labels Id rather be unlabeled but I identify myself as a physiologist and the reason for that is that I think neuroscience is a subset of physiology and is incorporated into the study of how things function as a prime mover but not the only one
    - Miller Well the next time I interview a neuroscientist I will ask if they actually agree with that definition
    - Dallman laughs
    - Miller Mary thank you so much for joining us on Science Caf today
    - Dallman Thank you

    - I call it a brain crackle that moment when synapses fire memories are burned and ideas are kindled Understanding how that happens is a scientific question Knowing that it does happen is a behavioral fact
    - There was a lot of crackling at the UCSFaffiliated Gladstone Institutes on July when hundreds of high school students from around the country participating in the National Student Leadership Conference were led through an engaging sampler of Gladstone science followed by handson demonstrations
    - View the introduction

    - The Gladstone has made a cultural virtue of outreach believing that the public understanding of science as well as our future supply of scientists mdash requires special attention Indeed the Gladstone Community Student Outreach Committee is dedicated to developing new programs and activities that capture students imagination and introduce them to the wonders of science goals the committee shares with UCSFs Science Health Education Partnership with whom it partners as well Every student benefits of course but program organizers particularly cultivate connections with minority students in the local community
    - Junipero Serra Elementary School in San Franciscos Bernal Heights neighborhood is just one example of how this principle works In Serra students and Gladstone scientists were pen pals
    - Here is an excerpt from one of the student letters
    - Id like to ask you some science questions How was the sun and moon formed How was mineral and water formed Now I would like to ask questions about you What ever made you get interested in science What kind of science do you study Do you study about nature animals space or others I cant wait till you come to my school I really like science
    - Here is an excerpt from the scientists response
    - I study how the different types of cells in the human body work and what happens to them when they get sick By looking at what goes wrong in a sick cell one can often find a way to help a sick person get better again
    - From such innocent encouraging exchanges brains come alive curiosity grows and new doors open Better yet its a twoway street Now thats a brain pathway we should all be so lucky to tread

    paragraphs: 
    - Hobart Harris MD MPH leads a double life maybe even a double double life if you throw in insignificant moments like eating and sleeping Yes hes a hepatobiliary surgeon the youngest son of a general practitioner Yes hes a scientist with his own NIHfunded laboratory And yes hes the division chief of General Surgery at UCSF
    - But he also writes screenplays And while many of us might claim a similar pastime it is California after all how many of us have written produced and directed our own film Well UCSF its time to meet your own version of The Blade the lead character created by Harris in Diary of a Blade circa
    - Hobart Harris
    - My brother Wendell B Harris Jr is a professional actor and writer and when we were kids growing up in Flint Michigan we were always making movies Our initial genres were horror and science fiction says Harris Stopaction animation films shot with an millimeter camera mounted on a tripod were particular favorites We used homemade figurines incorporated with live action and with very very rudimentary editing skills Harris laughs
    - The Harris family later opened a video production studio Their first independent film financed by a million dollars in private funds largely raised by Harris and his mother featured his older brother playing the role of a legendary Detroit impostor Called Chameleon Street the film went on to win the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival
    - We were incredibly nave Harris admits But we had a selfreliant attitude We created the opportunity ourselves rather than waiting for it to happen
    - After the Sundance success Hollywood called We were invited to Hollywood to meet a variety of producers They wanted to know about our next big idea
    - Was he tempted by the prospect of a film career
    - I looked the film profession square in the eye says Harris and I realized that I was not of the appropriate temperament to make that my profession But I also realized that on some level I would always be engaged with filmmaking whether that be by writing producing or directing I knew too that I would do it on my own terms rather than someone elses And it was in that spirit that the independent film Diary of a Blade conceived while Harris was a surgery resident at UCSF was made
    - Harris has brought that same singlemindedness to his medical career at UCSF where after his initial faculty appointment at San Francisco General Hospital he assumed his current position on the Parnassus campus
    - Who would ever suspect that Harris was once afraid of blood
    - Between my sophomore and junior years in college I spent a summer at Baylor College of Medicine in a program sponsored by Michael DeBakey I ended up working on some research projects that required that I perform surgery on animals I had never done anything like that before and in fact when I was growing up I was deathly afraid of needles and blood In some ways this was my test I found it absolutely captivating he says his voice rising with the memory And because it was I learned to manage my fear
    - The hundreds of patients with biliary liver and pancreatic diseases who have since been helped by Harris steady hands have reason to applaud this personal milestone
    - The thousands of Americans who suffer from sepsis not to mention the who die from this overwhelming consequence of infection each year are also cheering for an equally dramatic breakthrough That is if they were well enough to do so The sad fact is that sepsis is the leading cause of death in intensive care units around the world killing on average people every day
    - Harris a double threat as both surgeon and research scientist might not have the answer to the problem but he does have a novel idea He believes that lipoproteins produced in the liver and small intestine in addition to carting fat around our bloodstream play an equally important role in our immune response to infection And this is critical because inflammation not infection is the major cause of sepsisrelated tissue damage in the lungs liver kidneys and elsewhere
    - The immuneresponsetoinfection paradigm is that the body has both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses Harris explains Its a balanced response like driving a car with one foot on the accelerator and another one on the brake Sepsis can be seen as an imbalance between the pro and antiinflammatory responses of the host
    - The hypothesis that a particular family of lipoproteins including the famous triglycerides is part of the regulatory reactandrespond mechanism was Harris recalls essentially unheardof two decades ago when the work began in the laboratory of Harris research mentors Joseph H Rapp MD and John P Kane MD PhD UCSF professors of surgery and medicine respectively
    - While Harris acknowledges that he continues to toil in acting terms offoffoffBroadway scientific evidence is mounting in support of his essential idea He thinks of it as one of evolutions biological efficiencies
    - There are many examples in the body of molecules serving more than one purpose often executing different functions during different periods of development or under different circumstances Its simply more efficient We think lipoproteins have this dual function as well and it is within the context of this evolutionary doubling up this cooption if you will that we have made slow but steady progress
    - The elusive goal is simple enough a lipidbased therapy for sepsis And while this remains paramount Harris admits that his creative impulses are now inching him down a parallel path
    - I appreciate the creative opportunities research represents In surgery you are in many ways rewarded for performing according to established standards In research on the other hand you are rewarded for being creative for challenging dogma for seeking answers The creativity of clinical medicine is in the interpersonal delivery of care The creativity in science is in the search for the ever evolving nature of truth
    - One of the hidden secrets of science is the overwhelming influence of serendipity In the case of lipoproteins as components of the immune system the more you understand a system the more chances you have to exploit it While I still believe there will be lipidbased therapies for sepsis I also recognize that science leads you in directions you often cant predict I am open to the possibilities
    - And he finds himself in the right place One of the beauties of UCSF is the incredibly rich intellectual and scientific environment It has been very easy to form meaningful collaborations with many very talented scientists From my perspective UCSF is a scientific candy store
    - For exactly this reason Harris urges medical students residents and trainees to don the UCSF coat experiment with its rare blend of scientific creativity and openness and sample from the opportunity menu
    - You dont go to BaskinRobbins to order vanilla ice cream You go because it has flavors You dont come to UCSF just to become a good doctor although theres nothing wrong with that But at least sample from the menu even if you walk out with a vanilla cone
    - Harris leans forward and rests his elbows on the desk From the emotion in his voice to the powerful curl of his fingers you know that this is no act and that while he might have traded a prize for surprise he has still produced a winning life

    - James Cleaver
    - Much of what we know about how DNA repairs sundamaged skin or fails to do so has arisen in the last few decades thanks to scientists like UCSFs Jim Cleaver PhD Cleaver has a very long list of titles including member of the National Academy of Sciences but after more than years at UCSF he prefers to be known simply as a bench scientist who studies cancer
    - And why not It was at the bench that Cleaver first began to understand the underlying genetics of DNA repair by studying people with a rare disease known as xeroderma pigmentosum XP Lacking normal DNA repair mechanisms those born with XP must avoid sunlight altogether For them light itself is malignant And to survive what recessive genes have wrought they must become by necessity children of the night
    - Cleaver who has become one of the worlds leading experts on XP began his career studying genetic changes among atomic bomb survivors From his bench he has been both witness and participant in the socalled war on cancer and speaks with insight and hope about how a convergence of tools techniques and discoveries has set the stage for a new advance against this dreaded disease

    title: "Visualizing Life: A Conversation with Tom Ferrin, PhD"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Tom Ferrin
    - Life is complex This we know But when youre a pharmaceutical scientist the statement carries a quantifiable weight that a mere social observation does not
    - I was reminded of this fact in the past week in a conversation with Tom Ferrin PhD professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Biopharmaceutical Sciences and director of the Resource for Biocomputing Visualization and Informatics
    - Ferrin is a drug hunter a softspoken but passionate man who has inherited UCSFs rich legacy as the worlds leading simulation virtual screening and visualization center
    - Bluetongue virus infects cattle sheep and goats and has caused epidemics effecting millions of animals with large economic impact This crystal structure shows the virus capsid with viral RNA sticking to the outside The stickiness is thought to sequester viral RNA preventing an immune response in host cells Atomic contacts between RNA and capsid within angstroms are shown in black
    - Yes this is San Francisco but the visualization Im talking about has nothing to do with Zen chi or chakras What Ferrin and his pharmaceutical chemistry colleagues at UCSFs School of Pharmacy seek to see and interpret are molecules and their interactions And they want to be able to see manipulate and analyze them on their computer screens in three dimensions
    - This is a huge and daunting task made even more so by the deluge of biological data emerging from the many gene sequencing projects around the globe and one that requires special software and vast amounts of processing power to execute
    - Organization of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus genome Single strand RNA nucleotides depicted as a tube with A C G U shown in red yellow green and blue
    - Successive layers of orthoreovirus capsid fly away radially
    - UCSF researchers are the champions of the computational and visualization software world having at last count issued some licenses to industry and universities for just one of the newer packages known as Chimera
    - The first computerbased molecular docking software program called DOCK was developed at UCSFs School of Pharmacy by Irwin Kuntz PhD DOCK revolutionized the field in the s because it calculates and displays in three dimensions how potential drugs might attach to target molecules
    - Netropsin bound to doublestranded DNA PDB entry bna The DNA has been colored with the command rainbow and is shown with smooth ribbons stick bonds and special representations of the sugars and bases Netropsin is colored by element and shown in the ballandstick representation with a transparent pink molecular surface Water has been undisplayed
    - As Ferrin reminds us this allowed libraries of compounds to be virtually screened in weeks not years speeding up the entire process of drug development and saving incalculable amounts of money along the way
    - At the same time AMBER became one of the first and most widely used computer models of biomolecules and drugs AMBER has been used for designing drugs for predicting the effects of mutations on proteins and for understanding the structures and properties of proteins and DNA molecules Midas and Chimera followed
    - These tools are now essential and everevolving To understand just how essential consider this Since any protein can theoretically interact with another if humans have an estimated proteins you see how large the number of possible combinations there are says Ferrin
    - Sometimes for the lay reader the significance of this software feat is not easy to grasp But reading slowly and thoughtfully through this excerpt from Ferrins own webpage should at least give you a sense of why UCSF has become such a hotbed of computational innovation and a place where such knowledge is widely shared with the world
    - Modeled path of approximately nucleotides of single stranded RNA in satellite tobacco mosaic virus Crystal structure a contains segments of bases each that can be linked to form a continuous strand
    - Complementary to these structurebased approaches to studying macromolecular function the vast quantities of genomic data now available require new theoretical constructs and computational approaches for turning this data into scientific understanding Innovative computational methods such as genetic algorithms neural networks and hidden Markov models are providing powerful new software paradigms to relate sequence structure and functional information on a genomic scale
    - Making this information available to the scientific community through facile webbased interfaces is a considerable challenge but crucial if others are to benefit from and build on our work and hence constructing searchable and extensible databases using for example objectoriented programming techniques are required We are incorporating these approaches and others into integrated systems for molecular recognition in applications such as drug design protein engineering biomaterials design and bioremediation
    - Semliki forest virus The bowl of smoke is a angstrom resolution density map from electron cryomicroscopy The density map is sliced in half with colors from red to blue showing low to high density values on the cut surface A capsid protein forming a shell inside this enveloped virus is shown in blue green and pink
    - Semliki forest virus The bowl of smoke is a angstrom resolution density map from electron cryomicroscopy The density map is sliced in half with colors from red to blue showing low to high density values on the cut surface A capsid protein forming a shell inside this enveloped virus is shown in blue green and pink
    - There is beauty in this complexity a fact that is readily obvious when you scan the Chimera image library
    - There is a profound lesson too We have a lot left to learn
    - Maybe we should ponder that reality the next time we complain about a drugs effectiveness or blithely pop a pill oblivious to the inner world of interlocking systems it is about to change and to the intelligence of those like Ferrin who provided the first clues to how and why it might work
    - Yes life is complex And just as there is no free lunch there are no simple solutions to disease either

    title: "Visualizing Life: A Conversation with Tom Ferrin, PhD"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Tom Ferrin
    - Life is complex This we know But when youre a pharmaceutical scientist the statement carries a quantifiable weight that a mere social observation does not
    - I was reminded of this fact in the past week in a conversation with Tom Ferrin PhD professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Biopharmaceutical Sciences and director of the Resource for Biocomputing Visualization and Informatics
    - Ferrin is a drug hunter a softspoken but passionate man who has inherited UCSFs rich legacy as the worlds leading simulation virtual screening and visualization center
    - Bluetongue virus infects cattle sheep and goats and has caused epidemics effecting millions of animals with large economic impact This crystal structure shows the virus capsid with viral RNA sticking to the outside The stickiness is thought to sequester viral RNA preventing an immune response in host cells Atomic contacts between RNA and capsid within angstroms are shown in black
    - Yes this is San Francisco but the visualization Im talking about has nothing to do with Zen chi or chakras What Ferrin and his pharmaceutical chemistry colleagues at UCSFs School of Pharmacy seek to see and interpret are molecules and their interactions And they want to be able to see manipulate and analyze them on their computer screens in three dimensions
    - This is a huge and daunting task made even more so by the deluge of biological data emerging from the many gene sequencing projects around the globe and one that requires special software and vast amounts of processing power to execute
    - Organization of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus genome Single strand RNA nucleotides depicted as a tube with A C G U shown in red yellow green and blue
    - Successive layers of orthoreovirus capsid fly away radially
    - UCSF researchers are the champions of the computational and visualization software world having at last count issued some licenses to industry and universities for just one of the newer packages known as Chimera
    - The first computerbased molecular docking software program called DOCK was developed at UCSFs School of Pharmacy by Irwin Kuntz PhD DOCK revolutionized the field in the s because it calculates and displays in three dimensions how potential drugs might attach to target molecules
    - Netropsin bound to doublestranded DNA PDB entry bna The DNA has been colored with the command rainbow and is shown with smooth ribbons stick bonds and special representations of the sugars and bases Netropsin is colored by element and shown in the ballandstick representation with a transparent pink molecular surface Water has been undisplayed
    - As Ferrin reminds us this allowed libraries of compounds to be virtually screened in weeks not years speeding up the entire process of drug development and saving incalculable amounts of money along the way
    - At the same time AMBER became one of the first and most widely used computer models of biomolecules and drugs AMBER has been used for designing drugs for predicting the effects of mutations on proteins and for understanding the structures and properties of proteins and DNA molecules Midas and Chimera followed
    - These tools are now essential and everevolving To understand just how essential consider this Since any protein can theoretically interact with another if humans have an estimated proteins you see how large the number of possible combinations there are says Ferrin
    - Sometimes for the lay reader the significance of this software feat is not easy to grasp But reading slowly and thoughtfully through this excerpt from Ferrins own webpage should at least give you a sense of why UCSF has become such a hotbed of computational innovation and a place where such knowledge is widely shared with the world
    - Modeled path of approximately nucleotides of single stranded RNA in satellite tobacco mosaic virus Crystal structure a contains segments of bases each that can be linked to form a continuous strand
    - Complementary to these structurebased approaches to studying macromolecular function the vast quantities of genomic data now available require new theoretical constructs and computational approaches for turning this data into scientific understanding Innovative computational methods such as genetic algorithms neural networks and hidden Markov models are providing powerful new software paradigms to relate sequence structure and functional information on a genomic scale
    - Making this information available to the scientific community through facile webbased interfaces is a considerable challenge but crucial if others are to benefit from and build on our work and hence constructing searchable and extensible databases using for example objectoriented programming techniques are required We are incorporating these approaches and others into integrated systems for molecular recognition in applications such as drug design protein engineering biomaterials design and bioremediation
    - Semliki forest virus The bowl of smoke is a angstrom resolution density map from electron cryomicroscopy The density map is sliced in half with colors from red to blue showing low to high density values on the cut surface A capsid protein forming a shell inside this enveloped virus is shown in blue green and pink
    - Semliki forest virus The bowl of smoke is a angstrom resolution density map from electron cryomicroscopy The density map is sliced in half with colors from red to blue showing low to high density values on the cut surface A capsid protein forming a shell inside this enveloped virus is shown in blue green and pink
    - There is beauty in this complexity a fact that is readily obvious when you scan the Chimera image library
    - There is a profound lesson too We have a lot left to learn
    - Maybe we should ponder that reality the next time we complain about a drugs effectiveness or blithely pop a pill oblivious to the inner world of interlocking systems it is about to change and to the intelligence of those like Ferrin who provided the first clues to how and why it might work
    - Yes life is complex And just as there is no free lunch there are no simple solutions to disease either

    - Stefan Habelitz
    - Americans spend nearly billion every year whitening their teeth Yes thats right billion I wonder how many spend even a second thinking about what they are whitening Probably not many Enamel has simply become a billboard upon which to advertise health and vitality
    - Yet tooth enamel is far more than a billboard UCSF School of Dentistry researcher Stefan Habelitz PhD has been studying this wondrous and complicated crystalline product for more than a decade Only now are the rules laid down by millions of years of evolution being deciphered Habelitz is one of the translators
    - So what you ask while not I hope chewing at the same time My response Take the long view Dinosaurs had teeth coated in enamel And so do fish This is not to mention crocodiles whose powerful teeth have been with us for million years and whose biting power ranks just behind that of that legendary fleshshredder Tyrannosaurus rex
    - Human teeth might not pack the same kind of punch but they are tough and built to last a lifetime with proper care Topping the tooth is the glorious enamel crown which comes complete with a clever protective system that allows it to crack without breaking at least when everything is working well
    - But the most intriguing characteristic of all is how a largely inorganic substance like enamel is created by a very organic process involving proteins How does this happen And what does it mean when scientists like Habelitz break the code Will we have enamelstimulating toothpaste Will we able to grow entirely new natural teeth And will we be able to synthetically create a vast array of new biomaterials that function as superfast circuits on a nanometer scale

    title: Circling In on Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Obesity
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Could there be any two hotter topics in science these days than Alzheimers disease and obesity Using the Google trendometer the ubiquitous search turns up million references for Alzheimers and a whopping million for obesity Comparable figures on Yahoo are million and million respectively While that pales next to cancers hundreds of millions it does stagger the mind that with so much information bouncing around so little knowledge seems to be crossing the goal line
    - Lennart Mucke
    - Perhaps we are all suffering from early stages of cognitive decline I jest Or more seriously as UCSF neuroscientist Lennart Mucke MD reported at the recent From Molecules to Medicine minisymposium at UCSF Mission Bay some of us truly are experiencing nonconvulsive hardtodetect seizures in our learning and memory centers that could lead to Alzheimers disease
    - Indeed as Mucke director of the UCSFaffiliated Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease explained there seems to be much more going on with Alzheimers than loss of neurons or a disruption of synapses would suggest Circuits and networks also have to be involved
    - For anyone who has spent time with an Alzheimers patient Muckes notion as reported in Neuron seems right on target How else to explain how the person can seem dull and confused in the morning barely able to follow a conversation or spell a word and alert and interested at night telling jokes and regaling listeners with details of some recent event
    - Or as Mucke so aptly states These rapid fluctuations are unlikely to result from suddenly losing neurons then gaining them right back You cant be both losing and gaining neurons Plus learning and memory loss in Alzheimers are not associated with amyloid beta protein plaque buildup Something else must be happening to help people maintain a higher level of functioning
    - Now it seems that they do know what is happening Amyloid beta protein triggers an abnormal excitation of brain cells followed by an oversuppression of these same cells The electrical whipsaw may underlie the mystifying daytoday and sometimes hourtohour changes in the disabilities of Alzheimers patients
    - The good news If researchers and drug developers can figure out a way to suppress the seizures or minimize its impact and Muckes group has identified a strategy to do that in experimental Alzheimers disease models then it might be possible to prevent and even reverse cognitive impairments Better yet finding the right formula could protect against Parkinsons and ALS too
    - The notsogood news Science is a winding road with a lot of switchbacks Progress takes time Still for those of us starting on our downhill slide its encouraging to think that science might be there to help us put on the brakes
    - That is of course unless were so obese that the brakes give out With two out of three adult Americans now considered overweight that possibility cannot be ruled out
    - Now we all understand that eating less and exercising more is the key to a healthy weight But the scope of the problem is now so huge and the health consequences so severe that largescale behavioral change and a new national commitment to prevention assuming one arises would still leave millions behind
    - Robert Farese Jr
    - Science is stepping into that breach And Robert Farese Jr MD senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and UCSF professor of medicine biochemistry and biophysics tantalized the From Molecules to Medicine minisymposium audience with tales of how lipid droplets and fat storage are reshaping the debate
    - In short Farese and his Gladstone team have found that when they deactivate a particular gene called DGAT in mice the mice can eat as much as before and lose about half of their body fat How can this be
    - These mice have a to percent increase in energy expenditure They have increased oxygen consumption and they are more insulinsensitive says Farese Or to state it differently Their engines are running higher
    - Even more intriguing preliminary studies suggest that the mice protected as they are against fat storage might live longer
    - No wonder that drug companies are burning plenty of calories as they rush toward phase I clinical trials of a DGAT inhibitor
    - All in all a redletter report from Gladstone scientists and a big leap forward for UCSF science
    - Random Notes We are still evaluating the rather limited choices for UCSF research center and institute sites that carry the official UCSF web branding banner Expect to learn the winner soon Brian Shoichets Nature article was one of the most frequently downloaded from that journals site in August As we near the first anniversary of Science Caf I am happy to report that podcast downloads for previous stories have now passed

    - From organic compounds to organelles we talk a lot about the building blocks of life For most people its an apt metaphor But for others like UCSFs Tejal Desai PhD the term is a very literal career imperative You see Desai is a bioengineer someone who not only tries to understand how structures and systems inside living beings are designed and built but who also designs and builds her own micronano tools
    - What kind of tools are these Well imagine a kind of cloaking device that enables a drug to reach its target without provoking an immune response that would destroy it Imagine being able to control diabetes by creating a successful delivery system for replacement pancreatic cells Or consider microscopic scaffolds that support the growth of new cells to replace those lost to the blinding disease known as macular degeneration
    - These are just some of the wonders being worked up in Desais laboratory at UCSF Mission Bay within what is known as the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences or QB Desai is an enthusiastic awardwinning advocate for this fusion of engineering and biology She is also a compelling example of how a few encouraging words a special conference and a single teachers passion for the natural world can bridge the divide that often separates young women from careers in science

    title: "Old Space: Protecting Young Bones from Weightlessness. A Conversation with Thomas Lang"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Thomas Lang
    - Weightlessness has always seemed liberating a real and metaphorical escape from our daily burdens almost as I imagine flying would be
    - And astronauts certainly look happy almost giddy in fact when you see them floating freely inside a space vehicle And why wouldnt they be happy Floating in space must be an astonishing otherworldly sensation for a species like humans held so firmly in place by gravity
    - But we are terrestrial beings Evolution has shaped us Our bones and muscles draw strength from the very force pulling against them We pay a price for leaving Mother Earth And that price can be measured in dramatic fashion on some of Thomas Langs CT scans
    - To be precise says Lang PhD crews of a longduration space mission typically lose as much as percent of bone mass from their hips per month of spaceflight Compare that with agerelated osteoporosis particularly in elderly Caucasian women where a bone mass loss of less than percent per year is considered serious
    - Computed tomography images through the hip of an astronaut showing bone loss and recovery after a month mission aboard the International Space Station PRE image taken before flight POST Image taken at mission completion Image taken months after end of mission The red arrows show regions of high bone loss
    - Worse adds Lang his study of space crews revealed that after one year back on Earth their bone mass had still not recovered fully True his imaging technique of choice known as volumetric quantitative computed tomography did show that total bone mass had bounced back But while the hipbones were larger they were not as dense In essence the hipbones had reformed or remodeled themselves based on the degree of strain experienced by bonemaking cells
    - Armed with that data Lang and his colleagues set out to create a new kind of allinone exercise device that future space crews as well as those living on a proposed lunar base could use to preserve both bone and their sense of balance The goal now is to test it on volunteers confined to bed What they learn could change not only the future of space travel but also the nature of care for the frail elderly

    - Worse adds Lang his study of space crews revealed that after one year back on Earth their bone mass had still not recovered fully True his imaging technique of choice known as volumetric quantitative computed tomography did show that total bone mass had bounced back But while the hipbones were larger they were not as dense In essence the hipbones had reformed or remodeled themselves based on the degree of strain experienced by bonemaking cells
    - Armed with that data Lang and his colleagues set out to create a new kind of allinone exercise device that future space crews as well as those living on a proposed lunar base could use to preserve both bone and their sense of balance The goal now is to test it on volunteers confined to bed What they learn could change not only the future of space travel but also the nature of care for the frail elderly

    title: Mice or Men? How Important Is Conserved DNA? A Conversation with Geneticist Nadav Ahituv

    paragraphs: 
    - Nadav Ahituv PhD likes to juggle This assistant professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences and member of UCSFs Institute for Human Genetics even spent time training with a circus Its a handy skill when youre trying to understand genetic controls particularly those that are somehow embedded in the noncoding regions of our DNA regions that make up more than percent of our genome
    - Nadav Ahituv
    - In viewing this vast panorama of nucleic acids and all their possible interactions and relationships Ahituv looks for patterns And when youre looking at DNA one of the more interesting patterns absolutely has to be those sequences that are percent identical in different species
    - Take mice rats and humans for example Yes we share a common ancestor Somewhere around to million years ago we took a different evolutionary path But some parts of our genome to be precise DNA sequences remained the same Not kind of the same but exactly the same
    - While its tempting to use this piece of rodent evidence to explain why some people behave as they do the real news is that shared sequences by their very persistence over millions of years must be important and maybe even indispensable
    - Or so scientists hypothesized But thats one of the many great things about scientists They test their hypotheses And that is why Ahituv and his former colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Labs Genomics Division knocked out four different noncoding regions in mice to see what would happen
    - One would expect that the mice would have either died or been unable to reproduce After all it was widely believed that these noncoding regions near critically important genes act to enhance and regulate the various messages genes are capable of producing
    - But eliminating them did not seem to have any effect at all It was a huge surprise Just how big and what it all means is something Ahituv is now trying to understand

    title: Alternative or Not? A Conversation with Stephen Bent, MD
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Raise your hands if the answer to the following question is yes
    - How many of you have ever taken a vitamin pill ingested a supplement drunk an herbal brew or maybe sniffed a little aromatherapy
    - Stephen Bent
    - Im seeing a lot of hands raised No surprise there Americans are estimated to spend billion annually on alternative therapies
    - Now pretend Im your doctor I ask the same question Well there are a lot fewer hands raised Why is that do you suppose
    - Perhaps were all a little embarrassed that the doctor will feel slighted Or maybe its because we dont know why were taking what we do other than because its supposed to work Its an act of faith or perhaps one of selfdelusion
    - But the big question remains Do we really know what works
    - UCSFs Stephen Bent MD is helping us find out
    - Bent an assistant professor of medicine and an affiliate of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at UCSF spends his time when not seeing patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco researching the safety and efficacy of alternative therapies His particular interest is herbal remedies
    - There are a lot of reasons why his work is important For one it might save lives Remember the deaths linked to ephedra an herbal ingredient used in weight loss remedies and eventually banned by the FDA How about St Johns wort which interacts with many other drugs posing risks we cant imagine or predict
    - The key point is this Herbal remedies are drugs and we need to respect their ability to do harm as well as their potential to do good
    - As for how much good they might do Bent is the answer man

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller Welcome to Science Caf Today we welcome Steve Bent assistant professor of medicine at UCSF Hes also affiliated with the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine He also has his clinical practice in internal medicine at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Welcome Steve
    - Steve Bent Thank you
    - Miller Im very much looking forward to this interview Steve is our expert in evaluating alternative therapies and he also has an NIH Career Development award in this area Id like if you could explain that as we start so that everyone knows what exactly that is
    - Bent So a Career Development Award is given by the NIH to help develop a young investigators interests in a particular area and my area of interest was evaluating the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines And so thats my primary area of interest but I also have other areas of interest in alternative medicine more broadly
    - Miller What piqued your interest in this area initially
    - Bent Well thats somewhat of a complex question It dates back to my experiences in high school when I had some fairly progressive thinking teachers who liked to teach about meditation and other kinds of alternative practices And so I got interested in how those might be helpful for people and then carried that interest on into medical school and residency where I was noticing that patients werent always feeling very well healed by some of the therapies we offer and I thought it might be interesting to evaluate whether some of these alternative things couldnt be helpful for some people
    - Miller So in high school did you know that you wanted to be a doctor
    - Bent I didnt I was very interested in a lot of the sciencebased topics and sort of followed that line of study but I didnt really decide to become a doctor until I got further on in college
    - Miller Well now that you are one when you think back about your childhood is there anything that you see now that pushed you in this direction
    - Bent Well I had an older brother who went that direction and is a doctor now And I think I enjoy being around people I enjoy a practice where I have relationships with patients and I enjoy science so I think that mixes well together
    - Miller Did you have any family members who were in the medical field at all
    - Bent Not before my brother no
    - Miller And you grew up where
    - Bent I grew up in Short Hills New Jersey on the East Coast and went to school in the South and then out here for residency
    - Miller OK The last time I checked I read that about billion is being spent annually by Americans for socalled alternative therapies and I guess a subset of that would be herbal remedies which I think I read is around billion What is going on here Is this selfdelusion selfcare selfcontrol How would you define it
    - Bent Well its interesting I think you may be referring to a landmark study in that came out of Harvard that showed that people actually spend more outofpocket on alternative therapies than they do on traditional medical therapies
    - Miller And before we get to far lets define traditional and alternative Because depending on your perspective what is considered traditional or alternative can be variably defined
    - Bent Right Thats a good point And there is a variable amount of definition in different studies but typically alternative medicines are viewed as things that are not commonly offered at hospitals and clinics Now thats changed a lot in the past decade because some clinics have started to embrace these therapies and there gets to be this sort of funny definition where if something is proven effective it no longer becomes alternative But really I think alternative just generally refers to practices that havent previously been commonly taught to physicians and provided by medical providers
    - Miller In the West
    - Bent Correct
    - Miller So again selfdelusion selfcontrol selfcare
    - Bent So why are so many people using all of these
    - Miller Why Yes
    - Bent Well I think if you look at why people are using alternative therapies most of them are using them for conditions that are not welltreated by traditional medical therapies So you find a lot of people with chronic pain a lot of people with various kinds of mental illness and other treatments that arent like insomnia that we really dont have very many good therapies for So they go to a traditional doctor a few times they get the same old ineffective therapies or limited advice and they leave unsatisfied and so they start looking for other ways of treating things and thats where the alternative medicines come in
    - Miller How about the time spent with patients by alternative therapists Have you found there to be a big discrepancy
    - Bent There is Not surprisingly visits to alternative therapists are much longer theyre often in more relaxed settings with more bondingtype relationships between providers and patients and that may go a long way to explain why some of these treatments are effective
    - Miller Now UCSF has a reputation of being a pretty reductionist place where we dont allow too much woowoo in the towers as someone told me long ago I wonder as you approach these scientific studies where youre evaluating efficacy if you approach it with the mindset of someone who is out to find evidence that they do not work
    - Bent Well personally I try to stay open to everything I think of myself as being open to anything being potentially effective But Im also quite grounded in evidencebased practice so I really do like to see that any therapy that is touted as effective can be studied in a scientific manner and if it really is effective it should show effect So Im personally open to it but there hasnt been a lot of solid scientific evidence for many of these different therapies and thats one of my goals to try to bring science to prove that these things work if they really do and then we can provide those benefits to a wider array of people
    - Miller So how do you answer a critic who would say Well you cant really use Western scientific methods to measure the effectiveness of something like homeopathy
    - Bent I would argue that for almost any therapy you can design a solid scientific study to prove if it works or not And I think homeopathy is actually a pretty easy one because those remedies are very dilute solutions that have no taste and no smell and theyre clear liquids so you can design a placebo quite easily and that should be a relatively easy one Whats more difficult is something like acupuncture Its hard to create a placebo acupuncture although people are doing it and things like individualized Chinese herbal therapies where providers want to create a therapy thats specific just to that patient its hard to create a placebo treatment arm to compare to that treatment
    - Miller I mentioned earlier your affiliation with the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at UCSF Do you want to take just a minute or two to explain that affiliation and what that Center is all about
    - Bent The Osher Center which is part of UCSF has a mission to provide alternative therapies that have evidence of benefit to provide teaching to medical students faculty and residents here and then also to conduct research to further evaluate these therapies Im affiliated with them primarily in the research arm and work with many of the faculty there to develop new protocols and evaluate ongoing protocols
    - Miller So the studies that youre doing here at UCSF are usually in association with the Osher Center
    - Bent Yes thats correct
    - Miller Well I have looked at your list of publicationsyou have a very long listbut before we go through the individual remedies and treatments I wonder if there are some general things you might have to say to anyone considering taking a supplement or ingesting an herbal remedy Chinese or otherwise
    - Bent Well I think unfortunately in this country the herbal remedies and supplements are governed under an FDA Act called the DSHEA Act which is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of and it really provides very limited regulation of these supplements and herbs by the FDA so that no one is really monitoring or watching these supplements very carefully Even though theyre on the shelf next to the Tylenol and the ibuprofen these herbal supplements arent being checked by anyone to see if they have a consistent level of ingredients to make sure that they dont have contaminants or other problems in their production So one thing unfortunately is that consumers have to be very cautious about the products that they choose and should use ongoing servicesthere are some webbased services like consumerlabcom where you can actually check specific products to see if theyre relatively safe So I think one thing is to be aware of the fact that a lot of these products are not carefully monitored and theyre potentially dangerous for that reason
    - The second thing would be I would always advise patients to use these therapies in conjunction with their regular medical providers so they can discuss potential risks and benefits and how they might interact with anything else that theyre doing
    - Miller I think that there have been some studies that say that the willingness of patients to announce what theyre taking is limited
    - Bent Right And actually most patients dont discuss these therapies with their providers I think theres a feeling almost that the providers might view that as somehow an insult to their Western practice if theyre using something that their providers arent giving them But most providers I think are increasingly open to these therapies and would like to know if their patients are using them
    - Miller So disclose and dont take anything before checking
    - Bent Disclose Right And then I think finally is to try to be mindful of what effects the therapies are having sort of do your own clinical trial where you try to make very clear how youre feeling in whatever way youre treating before the therapy do a period of using it and see if it has any benefit and have some realistic expectations and assessment of whether or not the therapy was effective
    - Miller What about efforts that Ive read within China itself to actually standardize a lot of their herbal remedies and start exporting them in huge amounts Have you heard anything about that
    - Bent Yes and the whole concept of standardization I think is a good movement but its a very difficult one If you look at single herb products lets say for example gingko youll find that there are dozens of different chemical ingredients in that extract And so if you standardize it usually you pick one thing that you think is the likely effective ingredient although theres very little evidence to help you decide which thing that should be And you try to make sure that each product has the right amount of that particular one thing But it doesnt insure that you have the right amount of the other or different chemicals in there which might also be effective
    - Now thats complicated But now you take a Chinese herb which has or different herbs in it each which has or different chemicals and its very hard to really come up with a standardized product
    - Miller Well we have a long list of remedies and treatments that you have studied and Im just going to go through them so that you can tell me what youve found what your studies have shown Lets begin with the one I believe thats the most recent the saw palmetto study
    - Bent Yes
    - Miller So tell me about that
    - Bent So saw palmetto is an herb thats grown in the southeastern United States and became very popular in Europe for the treatment of urinary difficulties in men Most men as they get older have more trouble urinating and this therapy is widely prescribed in Germany Its actually the most commonly prescribed therapy for urinary difficulties in men There have been about
    - Miller At a standard dose or was that variable too
    - Bent No actually this is one of the few herbs where there is a consistent dose thats been used in all prior studies which is mg twice a day
    - So there were about prior studies and about half of those found a beneficial effect although most of the studies had methodological problems that
    - Miller Were these studies in Europe or studies in US
    - Bent They were mostly studies in Europe in fact they were all studies in Europe
    - So we thought since this was a promising herb that treats a common condition for which the therapies that are out there are only moderately effective that this might be a good herb to investigate So we did a study here based in San Francisco and with patients who came largely to the VA Hospital here to be enrolled in the study It was a randomized placebocontrolled trial where we compared men with this conditionwith urinary difficultiestaking saw palmetto or an identicalappearing placebo and we followed them for a year to see how their symptoms changed
    - Miller And what did you find
    - Bent And we found that there was no difference There was a small improvement in both groups but it was identical in the placebo group and the saw palmetto group
    - Miller And did you have any reaction to the published report of this study
    - Bent Well so the interesting thing about this is that it contradicted earlier findingsearlier findings were largely positiveso the big question is why Why were our results different And our main theory is that in the earlier studieswe actually asked many of the investigators in the earlier studies what they used for their placebo we actually obtained some samples of those placebos and they were gelatin capsules that contained a vegetable oil Now saw palmetto is a brown oily potentsmelling substance It smells terrible You open a can in the room and you can smell it Its very hard to create a placebo that looks and tastes and smells like saw palmetto So we went through great efforts to create a smelly badtasting brownappearing placebo that looked just like saw palmetto And we think the most likely explanation is that prior studies didnt use an adequate placebo so patients in the placebo group knew they were getting a fake pill and the ones who got the saw palmetto gained a placebo effect In our study because we had a good placebo it obscured the placebo effect
    - Miller I want to come back to that placebo effect a little later but lets move on to the next one now something called longevity treasure which was a Chinese herbal remedy correct
    - Bent Correct
    - Miller For chi
    - Bent Right So we were approached by a company in China who wanted to market their herbal remedy in this country and they believed it improved chi in elderly people Because thats somewhat of a difficulttounderstand conceptthe concept of chiwe asked them what they thought specifically it might help older people with and they thought it would be energy memory and sexual function
    - So we designed a studya randomized controlled trialwith specific instruments to measure those outcomes and we conducted the study in Beijing China This study had patients They were treated for a period of three months and we measured those outcomes before and after the treatment with the herbal product
    - Miller So what type of questionnaires did you have to measure the effectiveness of the product Was it strictly reporting if they were reporting on their sexual function
    - Bent So yes sexual function was a form which they reported and filled out Memory was a standardized memory test which was sort of word recall and picture recall Energy we used a sixminute walk and a stair climb and some weightlifting to see how well they physically performed And then we used a standard measure of overall health which is called the SF which is questions about how youre doing overall
    - Miller And was the Chinese company happy with your result
    - Bent Well there was a very small trend towards an improvement in a measure of depression It was a small improvement it was an improvement of two points on the scale People who are depressed who become not depressed improve about ten points and in this scale they improved about two points So the suggestion was that possibly there is some improvement in overall mental wellbeing but it was small and because this is just one study we cant be certain that it wasnt just by chance
    - I dont think the company was particularly excited because they were hoping for a more dramatic benefit that would help market their product in this country
    - Miller Lets talk about these small effects as we go through I think we had been told certainly by people who are experts in the area of evaluating alternative therapies that there is a tendency among the media to pick up the negative headline that slams the product and not to mention this very tiny effect that would get lost as hardly worth mentioning Do you see that happen more often than not
    - Bent I certainly have heard that criticism that people feel that media is biased against these products working and they try to pick up on the negative parts of the headline But my belief is that in order for people to be using an herb or a supplement or any other product there really ought to be very strong scientific evidence of a benefit Because if you take a product where there is no evidence theres an equal chance that it could be beneficial and harmful And if we dont have good evidence that it works I dont think its right to subject people to the potential risk of a bad outcome So I dont think the media has been unfair I just think that theres been limited research in establishing the efficacy of many of these therapies
    - And Id also like to offer that I think herbs and supplements in my mind are not that alternative They are similar to drugs In drugs when a patient has a problem we give them a pill and try to make them better An herb comes in a pill and most supplements come in pills too Its a way of trying to a patient walks into your office give them a package to make them better I think what really has promise in alternative therapy is giving patients tools to help themselves Like exercise like meditation diets and other therapies where they take a more active role in their overall health
    - Miller But theres something very appealing about pills obviously
    - Bent Certainly
    - Miller And lets go to the next one gingko
    - Bent So gingko is one of the herbs that does have fairly strong scientific evidence of efficacy And it is indicated for patients with dementia and has been shown in a number of studies to improve measures of dementia And there arent very many good medical therapies to treat this So I think it is a reasonable thing for patients with dementia to try
    - Miller Are there standards again for the production of gingko so if you buy it at the store you know what youre getting
    - Bent There is one specific product that has been tested many times You can find the specific product again if you go to some various resources on the internet that help you select which herb youre going to pick And I would recommend that when people use herbs or supplements that they use the exact product that was tested in clinical trials
    - Miller OK How about kava and valerian
    - Bent So we did an interesting study with some colleagues here of kava and valerian where we did the whole study over the internet which I thought was a very interesting technique because you can reach a lot of people very quickly We actually enrolled almost patients in six weeks which is quite a dramatic very fast study And in this study the patients had both insomnia and anxiety Kava is primarily targeted to treat anxiety and valerian is targeted to treat insomnia And in this study neither herb was more effective than placebo
    - Miller And again that was in patients
    - Bent patients yes
    - Miller Had there been published studies that indicated otherwise
    - Bent So there actually isagain kava is another herb where there is fairly strong evidence of efficacy for anxiety These patients had both anxiety and insomnia because we were trying to be efficient Perhaps it doesnt work as well in patients who have coexisting insomnia Or the internet population in generalwe were surveying people from all over the countryis a different population than in prior studies So I think there is pretty good evidence that kava works for anxiety Theres sort of equivocal evidence for valerian for the treatment of insomnia
    - Miller So when you publish these studies are there attacks from manufacturers
    - Bent Well you know most of the manufacturers for herbal products are pretty small shops and its often a struggle to get them to cooperate with the study because theyre just barely making it and for them to commit the resources to devote a supplement to a study is substantial Its not like a large pharmaceutical company that funds many trials ongoing at all times But in general when the studies come out negative the companies are upset and it gets harder and harder to recruit other companies for future studies
    - Miller But at least so far there hasnt been any indication that sales are dropping anywhere
    - Bent No Sales figures are difficult to track for herbs As I said theres lots of different small companies so its hard to tell but it appears that sales if anything have been continuing to slowly increase
    - Miller OK lets talk about another one that was in the news this year as well as last ephedra and then citrus aurantium
    - Bent Yes so this is an interesting story Ephedra is an herb that was used in Chinese herbal medicines for centuries and then became popular in this country a few decades ago as an agent for weight loss and for energy And it does have some bioactive ingredients it has something in it called ephedrine the extract which is a drug thats known to do things like increase blood pressure increase heart rate and it gives people a feeling of energy gives them sort of a charge like caffeine would Unfortunately because of these effects it also was associated with many different side effects and there were some very highprofile athletes who took ephedra supplements and then died One of them was Cory Stringer who was a lineman for the Minnesota Vikings and the other was a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles named John Beckler Both died after taking supplements And so it came under quite a bit of scrutiny from the FDA and was actually the first supplement that was ever banned due to safety concerns for that reason and for a number of different scientific studies showing that it likely did have significant toxic effects
    - Miller And then the citrus aurantium was a replacement right
    - Bent Yes So whats interesting is when that herb was banner the seven largest manufacturers of ephedrabased supplements immediately switched and took the ephedra out of their supplements and put in another herb called citrus aurantium Citrus aurantium has something in it called synephrin Synephrin is very similar chemically to ephedrine which was the reason that ephedra was banned But again because the regulation of these products is so limited the FDA doesnt really have the power to ask the companies or force them to do studies to document the safety before theyre sold So it will take if citrus aurantium really causes side effects it will take years if not more to detect the problem and then have the FDA ban it at some later time
    - Miller Is there a particular consumer caution around these remedies that profess to help you lose weight
    - Bent There is no official recommendation in that regard but in my opinion products that are used as weightloss aids or energy enhancers commonly have potentially dangerous herbs or often have added pharmaceutical drugs So some weightloss products have been found to have diuretics which cause you to urinate more frequently to help you lose weight And thats certainly not the way you want to lose weight
    - Miller OK St Johns wort
    - Bent St Johns wort has been used for a long time again most popular in Europe and there have been dozens of studies in Europe small studies showing a benefit for depression Interestingly there were then two large studies in this country with St Johns wort looking at patients with major depression where it was not effective Whats even more interesting is that in one of those studies they compared St Johns wort to a drug called sertraline and to placebo and not only was St Johns wort not effective but neither was the pharmaceutical drug sertraline So most experts in this area have concluded that St Johns wort probably is effective for mild depression It may not be effective for more severe depression And the one caution about that is that it is also known to interact with lots of different medications so if youre taking anything you really ought to be careful when using St Johns wort
    - Miller The whole drug interaction problem is really largely unexplored for a lot of these
    - Bent That is true And thats another reason that I feel like if you are going to use supplements or herbs you should try to do it in conjunction with a medical provider
    - Miller Echinacea
    - Bent Echinacea is an interesting one It is used for the common cold primarily Why is it so commonly used Because there are so many colds and theres really nothing effective for treating the common cold So everyone hopes for that magic supplement thats going to shorten their cold from ten days to five or three The evidence for Echinacea is mixed but the most recent highquality studies have not found an effect
    - Miller You mentioned hope so lets now talk about the placebo effect So lets just say maybe some of these or many of these are not particularly effectivethose that are not outright harmful So if people have a little extra money and they want to take it if it makes them feel better if its evoking the placebo effect is there anything wrong with that
    - Bent No not at long as its safe When we did the saw palmetto study and I was answering questions about that one of my thoughts about that was Gee Ive just ruined a perfectly good placebo And I think there is something to be said for that If individuals are taking something that is harmless and they feel better when theyre taking it why does it matter if theres scientific evidence of efficacy And so I try to be open for my patients who are using various therapies that are relatively harmless if theyre doing better on it and they feel better on it then thats fine
    - Miller So is the placebo effect really the power of the mind
    - Bent Well theres a lot of investigation into exactly how it works but its fairly consistent across lots of different types of studies and lots of different types of interventions that when you do something for people that looks like its gonna work if they believe it it actually makes them feel or perform better
    - Miller Any plans to study the placebo effect perhaps
    - Bent I have some colleagues at the Osher Center who are looking into that and looking into the precise sort of chemical mechanisms and neuronal mechanisms of how it actually happens but Im not on top of that research
    - Miller We havent talked about vitamin supplements at all I think many people assume that its OK to take mega doses of almost everything but I know thats not the case So can we pick out some particularly bad examples of things not to do
    - Bent There have been a lot of studies and people have hoped that they would find some kind of dramatic benefit from various different kinds of vitamin supplementation There have been some examples recently where highdose vitamin E which was originally believed to be helpful for preventing heart disease has actually been found to be harmful and increases the risk of bad outcomes There was also a vitamin called beta carotene that was believed to potentially prevent cancer and in smokers it actually increased the risk of cancer So there is I think an increased caution now to sort of routinely recommending that supplements and vitamins are going to help and I think thats appropriate and people should only take things that have established evidence of benefit There has also been a recent review of just the generic multivitamin tablet and whether thats known to prevent any bad health outcomes and theres really very limited evidence that daily use of a multivitamin does anything
    - Miller Well that should send some shock waves through the industry But lets talk about some individual ones I know the fatsoluble vitamins can accumulate and cause a lot of negative effects correct
    - Bent If you use high dosesand many people have the belief that if a little bit of some vitamin is good lets use tons of it and itll be even betterif you use high doses of any particular vitamin you can get toxic effects yes
    - Miller We havent talked about acupuncture much Have you done any serious studies of that
    - Bent I have not personally been involved in those studies but I am familiar with much of the research in that area And there is general consensus that acupuncture is effective for a number of different conditions primarily for chronic pain and back pain There was an interesting study that was just published showing that acupuncture is more effective than standard treatment for chronic back pain Interestingly in that same study sham acupuncture was almost as effective as acupuncture and more effective than
    - Miller OK lets stop right there So what exactly is going on do you think
    - Bent Well I think thats a pretty dramatic representation of the placebo effect Thats my personal belief of how that works But the sham acupunctureyou have patients go into the acupuncture room and lie on the table and theres a provider there who puts a fake needle up to their skin its like a toothpick that makes a feeling of a prick in the skin but doesnt really enter the skin and they put it at the wrong place they dont put it at the actual acupuncture point And I think the patients have an experience thats relaxing and believed to be a healing experience so they leave the room with a nice placebo benefit Their bodies have relaxed and they feel like theyre supposed to get better and they do get better
    - Miller Well should any of this be covered by our health plans if in fact it turns out to have some positive impact
    - Bent Coverage by health plans is an enormous question in many different ways I think health plans should cover the most effective therapies If they could cover all things that are proven to be effective that would be great but I think there has to be some level of triage based on cost
    - Miller Whats next for you in your research areas
    - Bent In this particular area I am interested in the safety of these herbs and supplements because theres limited data in that regard So were doing a study now at the VA where were examining herb and supplement use among all patients who are taking a blood thinner called Coumadin because there is some belief that these herbs may interact with that And thats one of the medications that has a very narrow safety profile In other words if you take too much or too little of it it can quickly lead to problems And I think those are the medications were most concerned about ones that just slight variations in the blood dose of those medicines could cause problems for some people
    - And then Im also interested in examining herbs or supplements that are used to treat conditions for which we dont as traditional providers do very well
    - Miller So what would be a list
    - Bent The top one on my list is Valerian which is used to treat insomnia I have in my practice so many patients who have trouble sleeping particularly as they get older and the therapies that weve tried really arent particularly effective So Im looking for something that might work better Beyond that Im really trying to find therapies that treat important medical conditions for which theres no existing therapy so cancer would also be at the top of my list
    - Miller Last question Is there a place where consumers can goyouve mentioned a couple of websitesa clearinghouse where they can get this information easily Now clearly your studies are all available on the UCSF website but theres a lot of information out there and some of its contradictory Is there a single place or maybe a couple of places where they can check
    - Bent There are two very good sources for reviewing herbs and supplements and those are a company called Natural Standard which is on the web at Natural Standard and another one called Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database Both of those unfortunately are subscription services so you have to pay a small annual fee But if herbs and supplements are something that youre going to be using regularly its a good place to get information and many physicians and medical providers have access to those sites so if you have specific questions you can ask your provider to look that up for you on those websites
    - Miller Thank you Steve This has been very informative I appreciate you joining me on Science Caf
    - Bent Thank you

    title: Alternative or Not? A Conversation with Stephen Bent, MD
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Raise your hands if the answer to the following question is yes
    - How many of you have ever taken a vitamin pill ingested a supplement drunk an herbal brew or maybe sniffed a little aromatherapy
    - Stephen Bent
    - Im seeing a lot of hands raised No surprise there Americans are estimated to spend billion annually on alternative therapies
    - Now pretend Im your doctor I ask the same question Well there are a lot fewer hands raised Why is that do you suppose
    - Perhaps were all a little embarrassed that the doctor will feel slighted Or maybe its because we dont know why were taking what we do other than because its supposed to work Its an act of faith or perhaps one of selfdelusion
    - But the big question remains Do we really know what works
    - UCSFs Stephen Bent MD is helping us find out
    - Bent an assistant professor of medicine and an affiliate of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at UCSF spends his time when not seeing patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco researching the safety and efficacy of alternative therapies His particular interest is herbal remedies
    - There are a lot of reasons why his work is important For one it might save lives Remember the deaths linked to ephedra an herbal ingredient used in weight loss remedies and eventually banned by the FDA How about St Johns wort which interacts with many other drugs posing risks we cant imagine or predict
    - The key point is this Herbal remedies are drugs and we need to respect their ability to do harm as well as their potential to do good
    - As for how much good they might do Bent is the answer man

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller Welcome to Science Caf Today we welcome Steve Bent assistant professor of medicine at UCSF Hes also affiliated with the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine He also has his clinical practice in internal medicine at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Welcome Steve
    - Steve Bent Thank you
    - Miller Im very much looking forward to this interview Steve is our expert in evaluating alternative therapies and he also has an NIH Career Development award in this area Id like if you could explain that as we start so that everyone knows what exactly that is
    - Bent So a Career Development Award is given by the NIH to help develop a young investigators interests in a particular area and my area of interest was evaluating the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines And so thats my primary area of interest but I also have other areas of interest in alternative medicine more broadly
    - Miller What piqued your interest in this area initially
    - Bent Well thats somewhat of a complex question It dates back to my experiences in high school when I had some fairly progressive thinking teachers who liked to teach about meditation and other kinds of alternative practices And so I got interested in how those might be helpful for people and then carried that interest on into medical school and residency where I was noticing that patients werent always feeling very well healed by some of the therapies we offer and I thought it might be interesting to evaluate whether some of these alternative things couldnt be helpful for some people
    - Miller So in high school did you know that you wanted to be a doctor
    - Bent I didnt I was very interested in a lot of the sciencebased topics and sort of followed that line of study but I didnt really decide to become a doctor until I got further on in college
    - Miller Well now that you are one when you think back about your childhood is there anything that you see now that pushed you in this direction
    - Bent Well I had an older brother who went that direction and is a doctor now And I think I enjoy being around people I enjoy a practice where I have relationships with patients and I enjoy science so I think that mixes well together
    - Miller Did you have any family members who were in the medical field at all
    - Bent Not before my brother no
    - Miller And you grew up where
    - Bent I grew up in Short Hills New Jersey on the East Coast and went to school in the South and then out here for residency
    - Miller OK The last time I checked I read that about billion is being spent annually by Americans for socalled alternative therapies and I guess a subset of that would be herbal remedies which I think I read is around billion What is going on here Is this selfdelusion selfcare selfcontrol How would you define it
    - Bent Well its interesting I think you may be referring to a landmark study in that came out of Harvard that showed that people actually spend more outofpocket on alternative therapies than they do on traditional medical therapies
    - Miller And before we get to far lets define traditional and alternative Because depending on your perspective what is considered traditional or alternative can be variably defined
    - Bent Right Thats a good point And there is a variable amount of definition in different studies but typically alternative medicines are viewed as things that are not commonly offered at hospitals and clinics Now thats changed a lot in the past decade because some clinics have started to embrace these therapies and there gets to be this sort of funny definition where if something is proven effective it no longer becomes alternative But really I think alternative just generally refers to practices that havent previously been commonly taught to physicians and provided by medical providers
    - Miller In the West
    - Bent Correct
    - Miller So again selfdelusion selfcontrol selfcare
    - Bent So why are so many people using all of these
    - Miller Why Yes
    - Bent Well I think if you look at why people are using alternative therapies most of them are using them for conditions that are not welltreated by traditional medical therapies So you find a lot of people with chronic pain a lot of people with various kinds of mental illness and other treatments that arent like insomnia that we really dont have very many good therapies for So they go to a traditional doctor a few times they get the same old ineffective therapies or limited advice and they leave unsatisfied and so they start looking for other ways of treating things and thats where the alternative medicines come in
    - Miller How about the time spent with patients by alternative therapists Have you found there to be a big discrepancy
    - Bent There is Not surprisingly visits to alternative therapists are much longer theyre often in more relaxed settings with more bondingtype relationships between providers and patients and that may go a long way to explain why some of these treatments are effective
    - Miller Now UCSF has a reputation of being a pretty reductionist place where we dont allow too much woowoo in the towers as someone told me long ago I wonder as you approach these scientific studies where youre evaluating efficacy if you approach it with the mindset of someone who is out to find evidence that they do not work
    - Bent Well personally I try to stay open to everything I think of myself as being open to anything being potentially effective But Im also quite grounded in evidencebased practice so I really do like to see that any therapy that is touted as effective can be studied in a scientific manner and if it really is effective it should show effect So Im personally open to it but there hasnt been a lot of solid scientific evidence for many of these different therapies and thats one of my goals to try to bring science to prove that these things work if they really do and then we can provide those benefits to a wider array of people
    - Miller So how do you answer a critic who would say Well you cant really use Western scientific methods to measure the effectiveness of something like homeopathy
    - Bent I would argue that for almost any therapy you can design a solid scientific study to prove if it works or not And I think homeopathy is actually a pretty easy one because those remedies are very dilute solutions that have no taste and no smell and theyre clear liquids so you can design a placebo quite easily and that should be a relatively easy one Whats more difficult is something like acupuncture Its hard to create a placebo acupuncture although people are doing it and things like individualized Chinese herbal therapies where providers want to create a therapy thats specific just to that patient its hard to create a placebo treatment arm to compare to that treatment
    - Miller I mentioned earlier your affiliation with the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at UCSF Do you want to take just a minute or two to explain that affiliation and what that Center is all about
    - Bent The Osher Center which is part of UCSF has a mission to provide alternative therapies that have evidence of benefit to provide teaching to medical students faculty and residents here and then also to conduct research to further evaluate these therapies Im affiliated with them primarily in the research arm and work with many of the faculty there to develop new protocols and evaluate ongoing protocols
    - Miller So the studies that youre doing here at UCSF are usually in association with the Osher Center
    - Bent Yes thats correct
    - Miller Well I have looked at your list of publicationsyou have a very long listbut before we go through the individual remedies and treatments I wonder if there are some general things you might have to say to anyone considering taking a supplement or ingesting an herbal remedy Chinese or otherwise
    - Bent Well I think unfortunately in this country the herbal remedies and supplements are governed under an FDA Act called the DSHEA Act which is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of and it really provides very limited regulation of these supplements and herbs by the FDA so that no one is really monitoring or watching these supplements very carefully Even though theyre on the shelf next to the Tylenol and the ibuprofen these herbal supplements arent being checked by anyone to see if they have a consistent level of ingredients to make sure that they dont have contaminants or other problems in their production So one thing unfortunately is that consumers have to be very cautious about the products that they choose and should use ongoing servicesthere are some webbased services like consumerlabcom where you can actually check specific products to see if theyre relatively safe So I think one thing is to be aware of the fact that a lot of these products are not carefully monitored and theyre potentially dangerous for that reason
    - The second thing would be I would always advise patients to use these therapies in conjunction with their regular medical providers so they can discuss potential risks and benefits and how they might interact with anything else that theyre doing
    - Miller I think that there have been some studies that say that the willingness of patients to announce what theyre taking is limited
    - Bent Right And actually most patients dont discuss these therapies with their providers I think theres a feeling almost that the providers might view that as somehow an insult to their Western practice if theyre using something that their providers arent giving them But most providers I think are increasingly open to these therapies and would like to know if their patients are using them
    - Miller So disclose and dont take anything before checking
    - Bent Disclose Right And then I think finally is to try to be mindful of what effects the therapies are having sort of do your own clinical trial where you try to make very clear how youre feeling in whatever way youre treating before the therapy do a period of using it and see if it has any benefit and have some realistic expectations and assessment of whether or not the therapy was effective
    - Miller What about efforts that Ive read within China itself to actually standardize a lot of their herbal remedies and start exporting them in huge amounts Have you heard anything about that
    - Bent Yes and the whole concept of standardization I think is a good movement but its a very difficult one If you look at single herb products lets say for example gingko youll find that there are dozens of different chemical ingredients in that extract And so if you standardize it usually you pick one thing that you think is the likely effective ingredient although theres very little evidence to help you decide which thing that should be And you try to make sure that each product has the right amount of that particular one thing But it doesnt insure that you have the right amount of the other or different chemicals in there which might also be effective
    - Now thats complicated But now you take a Chinese herb which has or different herbs in it each which has or different chemicals and its very hard to really come up with a standardized product
    - Miller Well we have a long list of remedies and treatments that you have studied and Im just going to go through them so that you can tell me what youve found what your studies have shown Lets begin with the one I believe thats the most recent the saw palmetto study
    - Bent Yes
    - Miller So tell me about that
    - Bent So saw palmetto is an herb thats grown in the southeastern United States and became very popular in Europe for the treatment of urinary difficulties in men Most men as they get older have more trouble urinating and this therapy is widely prescribed in Germany Its actually the most commonly prescribed therapy for urinary difficulties in men There have been about
    - Miller At a standard dose or was that variable too
    - Bent No actually this is one of the few herbs where there is a consistent dose thats been used in all prior studies which is mg twice a day
    - So there were about prior studies and about half of those found a beneficial effect although most of the studies had methodological problems that
    - Miller Were these studies in Europe or studies in US
    - Bent They were mostly studies in Europe in fact they were all studies in Europe
    - So we thought since this was a promising herb that treats a common condition for which the therapies that are out there are only moderately effective that this might be a good herb to investigate So we did a study here based in San Francisco and with patients who came largely to the VA Hospital here to be enrolled in the study It was a randomized placebocontrolled trial where we compared men with this conditionwith urinary difficultiestaking saw palmetto or an identicalappearing placebo and we followed them for a year to see how their symptoms changed
    - Miller And what did you find
    - Bent And we found that there was no difference There was a small improvement in both groups but it was identical in the placebo group and the saw palmetto group
    - Miller And did you have any reaction to the published report of this study
    - Bent Well so the interesting thing about this is that it contradicted earlier findingsearlier findings were largely positiveso the big question is why Why were our results different And our main theory is that in the earlier studieswe actually asked many of the investigators in the earlier studies what they used for their placebo we actually obtained some samples of those placebos and they were gelatin capsules that contained a vegetable oil Now saw palmetto is a brown oily potentsmelling substance It smells terrible You open a can in the room and you can smell it Its very hard to create a placebo that looks and tastes and smells like saw palmetto So we went through great efforts to create a smelly badtasting brownappearing placebo that looked just like saw palmetto And we think the most likely explanation is that prior studies didnt use an adequate placebo so patients in the placebo group knew they were getting a fake pill and the ones who got the saw palmetto gained a placebo effect In our study because we had a good placebo it obscured the placebo effect
    - Miller I want to come back to that placebo effect a little later but lets move on to the next one now something called longevity treasure which was a Chinese herbal remedy correct
    - Bent Correct
    - Miller For chi
    - Bent Right So we were approached by a company in China who wanted to market their herbal remedy in this country and they believed it improved chi in elderly people Because thats somewhat of a difficulttounderstand conceptthe concept of chiwe asked them what they thought specifically it might help older people with and they thought it would be energy memory and sexual function
    - So we designed a studya randomized controlled trialwith specific instruments to measure those outcomes and we conducted the study in Beijing China This study had patients They were treated for a period of three months and we measured those outcomes before and after the treatment with the herbal product
    - Miller So what type of questionnaires did you have to measure the effectiveness of the product Was it strictly reporting if they were reporting on their sexual function
    - Bent So yes sexual function was a form which they reported and filled out Memory was a standardized memory test which was sort of word recall and picture recall Energy we used a sixminute walk and a stair climb and some weightlifting to see how well they physically performed And then we used a standard measure of overall health which is called the SF which is questions about how youre doing overall
    - Miller And was the Chinese company happy with your result
    - Bent Well there was a very small trend towards an improvement in a measure of depression It was a small improvement it was an improvement of two points on the scale People who are depressed who become not depressed improve about ten points and in this scale they improved about two points So the suggestion was that possibly there is some improvement in overall mental wellbeing but it was small and because this is just one study we cant be certain that it wasnt just by chance
    - I dont think the company was particularly excited because they were hoping for a more dramatic benefit that would help market their product in this country
    - Miller Lets talk about these small effects as we go through I think we had been told certainly by people who are experts in the area of evaluating alternative therapies that there is a tendency among the media to pick up the negative headline that slams the product and not to mention this very tiny effect that would get lost as hardly worth mentioning Do you see that happen more often than not
    - Bent I certainly have heard that criticism that people feel that media is biased against these products working and they try to pick up on the negative parts of the headline But my belief is that in order for people to be using an herb or a supplement or any other product there really ought to be very strong scientific evidence of a benefit Because if you take a product where there is no evidence theres an equal chance that it could be beneficial and harmful And if we dont have good evidence that it works I dont think its right to subject people to the potential risk of a bad outcome So I dont think the media has been unfair I just think that theres been limited research in establishing the efficacy of many of these therapies
    - And Id also like to offer that I think herbs and supplements in my mind are not that alternative They are similar to drugs In drugs when a patient has a problem we give them a pill and try to make them better An herb comes in a pill and most supplements come in pills too Its a way of trying to a patient walks into your office give them a package to make them better I think what really has promise in alternative therapy is giving patients tools to help themselves Like exercise like meditation diets and other therapies where they take a more active role in their overall health
    - Miller But theres something very appealing about pills obviously
    - Bent Certainly
    - Miller And lets go to the next one gingko
    - Bent So gingko is one of the herbs that does have fairly strong scientific evidence of efficacy And it is indicated for patients with dementia and has been shown in a number of studies to improve measures of dementia And there arent very many good medical therapies to treat this So I think it is a reasonable thing for patients with dementia to try
    - Miller Are there standards again for the production of gingko so if you buy it at the store you know what youre getting
    - Bent There is one specific product that has been tested many times You can find the specific product again if you go to some various resources on the internet that help you select which herb youre going to pick And I would recommend that when people use herbs or supplements that they use the exact product that was tested in clinical trials
    - Miller OK How about kava and valerian
    - Bent So we did an interesting study with some colleagues here of kava and valerian where we did the whole study over the internet which I thought was a very interesting technique because you can reach a lot of people very quickly We actually enrolled almost patients in six weeks which is quite a dramatic very fast study And in this study the patients had both insomnia and anxiety Kava is primarily targeted to treat anxiety and valerian is targeted to treat insomnia And in this study neither herb was more effective than placebo
    - Miller And again that was in patients
    - Bent patients yes
    - Miller Had there been published studies that indicated otherwise
    - Bent So there actually isagain kava is another herb where there is fairly strong evidence of efficacy for anxiety These patients had both anxiety and insomnia because we were trying to be efficient Perhaps it doesnt work as well in patients who have coexisting insomnia Or the internet population in generalwe were surveying people from all over the countryis a different population than in prior studies So I think there is pretty good evidence that kava works for anxiety Theres sort of equivocal evidence for valerian for the treatment of insomnia
    - Miller So when you publish these studies are there attacks from manufacturers
    - Bent Well you know most of the manufacturers for herbal products are pretty small shops and its often a struggle to get them to cooperate with the study because theyre just barely making it and for them to commit the resources to devote a supplement to a study is substantial Its not like a large pharmaceutical company that funds many trials ongoing at all times But in general when the studies come out negative the companies are upset and it gets harder and harder to recruit other companies for future studies
    - Miller But at least so far there hasnt been any indication that sales are dropping anywhere
    - Bent No Sales figures are difficult to track for herbs As I said theres lots of different small companies so its hard to tell but it appears that sales if anything have been continuing to slowly increase
    - Miller OK lets talk about another one that was in the news this year as well as last ephedra and then citrus aurantium
    - Bent Yes so this is an interesting story Ephedra is an herb that was used in Chinese herbal medicines for centuries and then became popular in this country a few decades ago as an agent for weight loss and for energy And it does have some bioactive ingredients it has something in it called ephedrine the extract which is a drug thats known to do things like increase blood pressure increase heart rate and it gives people a feeling of energy gives them sort of a charge like caffeine would Unfortunately because of these effects it also was associated with many different side effects and there were some very highprofile athletes who took ephedra supplements and then died One of them was Cory Stringer who was a lineman for the Minnesota Vikings and the other was a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles named John Beckler Both died after taking supplements And so it came under quite a bit of scrutiny from the FDA and was actually the first supplement that was ever banned due to safety concerns for that reason and for a number of different scientific studies showing that it likely did have significant toxic effects
    - Miller And then the citrus aurantium was a replacement right
    - Bent Yes So whats interesting is when that herb was banner the seven largest manufacturers of ephedrabased supplements immediately switched and took the ephedra out of their supplements and put in another herb called citrus aurantium Citrus aurantium has something in it called synephrin Synephrin is very similar chemically to ephedrine which was the reason that ephedra was banned But again because the regulation of these products is so limited the FDA doesnt really have the power to ask the companies or force them to do studies to document the safety before theyre sold So it will take if citrus aurantium really causes side effects it will take years if not more to detect the problem and then have the FDA ban it at some later time
    - Miller Is there a particular consumer caution around these remedies that profess to help you lose weight
    - Bent There is no official recommendation in that regard but in my opinion products that are used as weightloss aids or energy enhancers commonly have potentially dangerous herbs or often have added pharmaceutical drugs So some weightloss products have been found to have diuretics which cause you to urinate more frequently to help you lose weight And thats certainly not the way you want to lose weight
    - Miller OK St Johns wort
    - Bent St Johns wort has been used for a long time again most popular in Europe and there have been dozens of studies in Europe small studies showing a benefit for depression Interestingly there were then two large studies in this country with St Johns wort looking at patients with major depression where it was not effective Whats even more interesting is that in one of those studies they compared St Johns wort to a drug called sertraline and to placebo and not only was St Johns wort not effective but neither was the pharmaceutical drug sertraline So most experts in this area have concluded that St Johns wort probably is effective for mild depression It may not be effective for more severe depression And the one caution about that is that it is also known to interact with lots of different medications so if youre taking anything you really ought to be careful when using St Johns wort
    - Miller The whole drug interaction problem is really largely unexplored for a lot of these
    - Bent That is true And thats another reason that I feel like if you are going to use supplements or herbs you should try to do it in conjunction with a medical provider
    - Miller Echinacea
    - Bent Echinacea is an interesting one It is used for the common cold primarily Why is it so commonly used Because there are so many colds and theres really nothing effective for treating the common cold So everyone hopes for that magic supplement thats going to shorten their cold from ten days to five or three The evidence for Echinacea is mixed but the most recent highquality studies have not found an effect
    - Miller You mentioned hope so lets now talk about the placebo effect So lets just say maybe some of these or many of these are not particularly effectivethose that are not outright harmful So if people have a little extra money and they want to take it if it makes them feel better if its evoking the placebo effect is there anything wrong with that
    - Bent No not at long as its safe When we did the saw palmetto study and I was answering questions about that one of my thoughts about that was Gee Ive just ruined a perfectly good placebo And I think there is something to be said for that If individuals are taking something that is harmless and they feel better when theyre taking it why does it matter if theres scientific evidence of efficacy And so I try to be open for my patients who are using various therapies that are relatively harmless if theyre doing better on it and they feel better on it then thats fine
    - Miller So is the placebo effect really the power of the mind
    - Bent Well theres a lot of investigation into exactly how it works but its fairly consistent across lots of different types of studies and lots of different types of interventions that when you do something for people that looks like its gonna work if they believe it it actually makes them feel or perform better
    - Miller Any plans to study the placebo effect perhaps
    - Bent I have some colleagues at the Osher Center who are looking into that and looking into the precise sort of chemical mechanisms and neuronal mechanisms of how it actually happens but Im not on top of that research
    - Miller We havent talked about vitamin supplements at all I think many people assume that its OK to take mega doses of almost everything but I know thats not the case So can we pick out some particularly bad examples of things not to do
    - Bent There have been a lot of studies and people have hoped that they would find some kind of dramatic benefit from various different kinds of vitamin supplementation There have been some examples recently where highdose vitamin E which was originally believed to be helpful for preventing heart disease has actually been found to be harmful and increases the risk of bad outcomes There was also a vitamin called beta carotene that was believed to potentially prevent cancer and in smokers it actually increased the risk of cancer So there is I think an increased caution now to sort of routinely recommending that supplements and vitamins are going to help and I think thats appropriate and people should only take things that have established evidence of benefit There has also been a recent review of just the generic multivitamin tablet and whether thats known to prevent any bad health outcomes and theres really very limited evidence that daily use of a multivitamin does anything
    - Miller Well that should send some shock waves through the industry But lets talk about some individual ones I know the fatsoluble vitamins can accumulate and cause a lot of negative effects correct
    - Bent If you use high dosesand many people have the belief that if a little bit of some vitamin is good lets use tons of it and itll be even betterif you use high doses of any particular vitamin you can get toxic effects yes
    - Miller We havent talked about acupuncture much Have you done any serious studies of that
    - Bent I have not personally been involved in those studies but I am familiar with much of the research in that area And there is general consensus that acupuncture is effective for a number of different conditions primarily for chronic pain and back pain There was an interesting study that was just published showing that acupuncture is more effective than standard treatment for chronic back pain Interestingly in that same study sham acupuncture was almost as effective as acupuncture and more effective than
    - Miller OK lets stop right there So what exactly is going on do you think
    - Bent Well I think thats a pretty dramatic representation of the placebo effect Thats my personal belief of how that works But the sham acupunctureyou have patients go into the acupuncture room and lie on the table and theres a provider there who puts a fake needle up to their skin its like a toothpick that makes a feeling of a prick in the skin but doesnt really enter the skin and they put it at the wrong place they dont put it at the actual acupuncture point And I think the patients have an experience thats relaxing and believed to be a healing experience so they leave the room with a nice placebo benefit Their bodies have relaxed and they feel like theyre supposed to get better and they do get better
    - Miller Well should any of this be covered by our health plans if in fact it turns out to have some positive impact
    - Bent Coverage by health plans is an enormous question in many different ways I think health plans should cover the most effective therapies If they could cover all things that are proven to be effective that would be great but I think there has to be some level of triage based on cost
    - Miller Whats next for you in your research areas
    - Bent In this particular area I am interested in the safety of these herbs and supplements because theres limited data in that regard So were doing a study now at the VA where were examining herb and supplement use among all patients who are taking a blood thinner called Coumadin because there is some belief that these herbs may interact with that And thats one of the medications that has a very narrow safety profile In other words if you take too much or too little of it it can quickly lead to problems And I think those are the medications were most concerned about ones that just slight variations in the blood dose of those medicines could cause problems for some people
    - And then Im also interested in examining herbs or supplements that are used to treat conditions for which we dont as traditional providers do very well
    - Miller So what would be a list
    - Bent The top one on my list is Valerian which is used to treat insomnia I have in my practice so many patients who have trouble sleeping particularly as they get older and the therapies that weve tried really arent particularly effective So Im looking for something that might work better Beyond that Im really trying to find therapies that treat important medical conditions for which theres no existing therapy so cancer would also be at the top of my list
    - Miller Last question Is there a place where consumers can goyouve mentioned a couple of websitesa clearinghouse where they can get this information easily Now clearly your studies are all available on the UCSF website but theres a lot of information out there and some of its contradictory Is there a single place or maybe a couple of places where they can check
    - Bent There are two very good sources for reviewing herbs and supplements and those are a company called Natural Standard which is on the web at Natural Standard and another one called Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database Both of those unfortunately are subscription services so you have to pay a small annual fee But if herbs and supplements are something that youre going to be using regularly its a good place to get information and many physicians and medical providers have access to those sites so if you have specific questions you can ask your provider to look that up for you on those websites
    - Miller Thank you Steve This has been very informative I appreciate you joining me on Science Caf
    - Bent Thank you

    title: "A Postdoc&rsquo;s Story: Greece&rsquo;s Christina Karatzaferi Remembers UCSF"

    paragraphs: 
    - Christina Karatzaferi
    - Editors Note UCSFs impact on the world is not always easy to quantify particularly when rooted in personal experience But it is safe to say that the changing rotation of or so postdoctoral scholars many of them foreignborn who spend time in UCSF laboratories carry the UCSF spirit with them as they continue their careers in other locales Christina Karatzaferi PhD a former postdoc in the lab of UCSFs Roger Cooke PhD exemplifies that tradition Now working in Greece Karatzaferi tells a story that also personalizes the saga of sciences workforce warriors who pursue knowledge wherever it leads
    - My father is Greek and my mother RitaMaria is Brazilian I am one of six children My dad studied chemical engineering in Italy but he became a merchant traveller and adventurer he has crossed the Amazon jungle a number of times has travelled throughout the Americas and is still travelling nowadays My mom studied with the nuns and was training to become a teacher She dropped out of her studies when she got married I was born in Venezuela but our family moved to Athens when I was about so I did all my schooling and growing up in Greece in the city of Kallithea Athens in essence is a collection of many municipalities Kallithea has a population of
    - I had school trouble at the beginning since I only spoke Spanish and was slow picking up Greek However the day came when I started making sense of it all and from the moment I started reading Greek I didnt stop
    - I would read everything from cereal cartons to my grandpas encyclopaedias anytime anywhere My mom and dad would kiss us goodnight and then my dad would sneak up on me and find me reading under the blankets with my flashlight My mom would ask me to keep an eye on the broiling food and I would be so immersed in my readings that she would return to the kitchen to find me continuing to read while the food was burning in the stove and thick smoke made the kitchen look like a battlefield I especially loved Jules Vernes stories and by the age of I had read all the books of the school library This didnt faze me I just started rereading my favourites
    - At around the same time our older cousin started teaching my sister and me how to play basketball He also posed simple math problems or questioned us in riddles Our cousins first wife gave me a science book for kids when I was about I loved it My mom was devastated when she caught me doing experiments in the bathroom She was worried a that I would get hurt b that I might hurt a member of the family and c that I was turning into a tomboy Truth is I was always very athletic I eventually enrolled in a basketball club at a young age and ended up having a long professional playing career
    - In university I studied physical education and sport science and graduated in from the University of Athens with a BSc Hon in sport science and a coaching specialization in basketball My university years were very enlightening especially the time spent in the exercise physiology lab or listening to the superb lectures delivered by Professor Klissouras the first exercise physiologist in Greece and a pioneer in twin studies of exercise physiology Still I didnt consider science as a career option While a student I had started working as a basketball coach with good results albeit lousy pay
    - Gaining my full credentials at graduation I expected that my coaching career would soar Instead I hit the glass ceiling Women basketball coaches were not exactly taken seriously then and I am afraid may still not be in Greece I had to rethink what my career aspirations were I then realized that I missed the logic of my studies the acquisition of new knowledge the intellectual challenge in the academic environment
    - So what if I pursued further education in science I had the aptitude and had shown academic promise To discuss what my options were I visited my old department and had a meeting with Dr Maria Maridaki now an associate professor in exercise physiology at the University of Athens who I heard had studied in the UK It was the first time that I had a proper discussion with a career woman who had studied abroad and she gave me a new perspective Adventure was calling me Science experimentation academia I felt that I could fit there albeit only for a masters as I thought then
    - I worked for another year to save up some money my parents gave me a generous startup sum and I got accepted to Loughborough University UK to study for a masters degree in sport science
    - After finishing my MSc thesis with Professor Clyde Williams I looked for a PhD fellowship The science bug had bitten me and there was no return I ended up at Manchester Metropolitan University MMU doing experiments in muscle metabolism during sprinting especially using singlemuscle fibre techniques
    - My time at MMU was very exciting In that department there was a total of PhDs in all disciplines and seven of them were Greek After finishing my PhD at MMU I got a position as a lecturer in exercise physiology at the University of Edinburgh The department had a more applied orientation and I got interested in ageing effects on muscle function At the same time I felt that I needed a researchdedicated environment with less or no teaching and administration if my research were to remain close to basic questions of muscle function All these factors together led me to the decision to seek a position in the USA
    - Why UCSF The short answer because of Roger Cooke and his seminal work in muscle biophysics Cookes research was required reading in some of my masters classes and I could clearly see that the Cooke lab had a tradition in investigating factors affecting actomyosin interaction in an effort to decipher the mechanisms of muscle fatigue I boldly emailed Professor Cooke my CV and reference letters describing in a statement my previous work and explaining that I would like to learn more about how muscle mechanics are affected by fatigue
    - I was very lucky that Professor Cooke had not yet found anyone willing to do singlefibre mechanics So I was a good fit for him given my prior experience with dissection and my background on muscle physiology and metabolism On the other hand my total lack of a biophysics background meant that I had many new things to learn which in itself I viewed not as a problem but rather made my move to San Francisco very exciting
    - During my first few weeks at UCSF I felt quite oldfashioned In the UK or at least in the UK to years ago things in academia were more formal than in the USA One would address others especially older members of staff with their title Dr Professor Sir etc They would use very polite language would you could you etc and would say thank you and please Men always held the door open for women and staff dressed up for work
    - At UCSF Roger asked me to call him Roger immediately Grad students late for classes had no qualms about not holding the elevator doors open for anyone else It was a cultural shock and it made me wonder if I were a prude At the same time I was elated that I could go to work in my jeans and Tshirt San Francisco was an extremely friendly place and UCSF itself was just the place for me to test my abilities in coming up with ideas working in a competitive environment and specializing in an issue I started experiments immediately continuing first on a project started by a previous postdoc now a professor in South Africa Kathy Myburgh with whom we later collaborated in that project
    - I will never forget the first time I loaded a muscle fibre and observed its behavior I was used to dissecting freezedried muscle fibres doing the histochemistry or biochemistry of muscle a more passive view of muscle But watching a muscle fibre contracting was something else I loved it Moreover because Roger is a very handson professor I got involved in fixing stuff myself
    - We would spend some time together mending a broken force transducer It may sound odd but these were some of the best moments in the lab We would be fixing this part or the other we would be talking of some basic engineering or physics concept then we would have to leave the epoxy glue to set and walk down the flights of stairs at Parnassus to the cafeteria We would eat a sandwich and discuss more science draw concepts on napkins talk to other people Roger was very good in introducing me around and then we would walk the flights of stairs up while discussing muscle energy expenditure back to the lab Hopefully by then the equipment would be ready to work and my work would continue
    - My time at the Cooke lab was very productive and it definitely follows me now More importantly the whole experience there matured me as a scientist I got to write grant applications I was exposed to seminars on anything from writing grants to adding creativity in everyday scientific work As for interaction and collaboration which was greatly promoted after the biochemistry department moved to Mission Bay I was able to participate in a great project that resulted in the publication of crystal structure and the functional characterization of the skeletal muscle troponin led by Maia Vinogradova and Robert Fletterick How much better could scientific mingling could get
    - Moreover through my involvement in the women in science groups I got to meet other women fellows postdocs researchers and grad students get mentorship or offer mentorship and had the opportunity to teach some classes at UC Berkeley Extension All these experiences really mattered for my personal and career development
    - When I moved back to Greece in it was to take a post as a lecturer in exercise physiology with both teaching and research and yes administrative work Tenure track posts in Greece Greece follows something like the fourtier UK system dont come easily so I am happy that I have this post in a new department in an established university the University of Thessaly Unfortunately basic research receives very low monetary support here in terms of both government money and available competitive opportunities
    - But I believe the tide is turning for the better At the university I found researchoriented colleagues and administrators who gave me the opportunity to collaborate in physiologyrelated projects while seeking funding to set up my lab These include Professor Yiannis Koutedakis my senior colleague Professor Ioannis Stefanidis and Georgios Sakkas MD I supervise postgraduate students I am just concluding a project on using antioxidant supplements and I collaborate closely in clinical studies with a group from the department of medicine concerning exercise rehabilitation in dialysis patients and how exercise improves the symptoms of various comorbidities in this patient population Publications from such work in Greece have just started coming out
    - Recently we won funding for a research institute in the area of exercise for health and rehabilitation PerfoTech one of the four institutes of the Center for Research Technology in Thessaly I have just set up a muscle lab which is probably the first of its kind in Greece and we are open for business As the institutes physiology research coordinator I am writing grant proposals mainly directed to the EU Commission or to the Hellenic General Secretariat for Research and Technology and I organize physiologyrelated research projects
    - I think about UCSF often I feel privileged to have spent about four years with such a curious and adventurous bunch of people interacting collaborating or dressing up for a Dr Seussthemed Christmas party I have left a piece of my heart in San Francisco so any excuse will do for me to come back

    title: Ideas Make Good Presents

    paragraphs: 
    - Science Caf passes another milestone this week our st edition If we were a television sitcom we would throw a party But since we cannot house the thousands of Science Caf readers from Alameda to Addis Ababa I will do the next best thing and send some gifts your way Not that kind of gifts the other kind the ones that make you smile nod your head ponder email to a friend or print out for future reference Ill call them ideas sometimes disguised as information
    - So what is the most popular Science Caf produced so far The prize goes to the surgeonscientist with the electrifying name Electron Kebebew MD His story tops the list with page views to date Electron has also been downloaded as a podcast times Thats not easy Hes very tall
    - Runnerup in the mostread category is Alcoholism Vice or Disease my first of three conversations with Howard Fields MD PhD a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of UCSFs Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction In third place is my story on the work of Mary Dallman PhD The Biology of Fat
    - What does this mean The most cynical among us might say that readers seem to be most interested in why they drink and what they eat and who can fix them up when addictions take their toll I prefer to believe that readers want answers and that they pardon the pun hunger for real experts
    - Biggest Science Caf surprise The success of the podcasts hands down At last count the number of Science Caf podcast downloads was nearly Thank you loyal listeners
    - Speaking of winners whatever happened to the best science website contest advertised on these pages Thanks to Scott Oakes MD from the Department of Pathology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Colin Fahrion from the Division of Pediatric Surgery for submitting their sites for consideration Both sites use the UCSF web banner correctly which in itself is worth applauding But our review of websites for the larger science community at UCSF revealed so many bad examples that we decided to hold the prize this year and roll it over to next season
    - Now heres something we should all rally behind maybe even stage at UCSF In an article in the Washington Post Matthew Chapman has thrown down the gauntlet to our long list of presidential candidates He has called for a presidential debate solely on the subject of science
    - As Chapman writes We must elect a president with a basic understanding of st century science He recommends that the debate not test arcane knowledge but general principles and deep thinking about what the scientific method means to the acquisition of knowledge I would be willing to moderate this debate for free
    - I have been saving these story links from the summer of Enjoy Heres a story on why we need to know more about the interaction between food and prescription drugs Heres another one about food Could taxes on foods that make us fat save lives Switching gears I pass along this link to a disturbing story about how the parasitic worm that causes river blindness is developing drug resistance This story has a UCSF angle James McKerrow MD PhD is working toward a new treatment for river blindness among other parasitic diseases

    - I mention this additional story on a cure for PTSD not because it was conducted only in mice but as a segue to the real story taking place at the UCSFaffiliated San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center There in the Northern California Institute for Research and Education NCIRE also known as the Veterans Health Research Institute founded in collaboration with the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs the nations first Neuroscience Center of Excellence

    - As a former history major I am happy to announce that Big History has arrived For those who dont know and I count myself among the ignorant at least until a few months ago a new breed of historian has emerged in the last years or so Led by San Diego State Universitys David Christian PhD and others this field seeks to fuse human history and natural history and examine this fusion from the beginning of time to the present
    - If you give no other book to a deepthinking or curious friend make it Christians masterpiece Maps of Time At pages it is a big read but every page is rich with provocative and thoughtful details
    - Consider this statement about the role of collective learning in human evolution Humans as individuals are not that much cleverer than chimps or Neanderthals but as a species we are vastly more creative because our knowledge is shared within and between generations All in all collective learning is so powerful an adaptive mechanism that one might argue it plays a role in human history analogous to that of natural selection in the histories of other organisms
    - Some of these insights you might have read elsewhere or already know but the magic is in the multidisciplinary context Maybe it should be required reading for the presidential debate on science Now that would be a milestone

    - Science Caf passes another milestone this week our st edition If we were a television sitcom we would throw a party But since we cannot house the thousands of Science Caf readers from Alameda to Addis Ababa I will do the next best thing and send some gifts your way Not that kind of gifts the other kind the ones that make you smile nod your head ponder email to a friend or print out for future reference Ill call them ideas sometimes disguised as information
    - So what is the most popular Science Caf produced so far The prize goes to the surgeonscientist with the electrifying name Electron Kebebew MD His story tops the list with page views to date Electron has also been downloaded as a podcast times Thats not easy Hes very tall
    - Runnerup in the mostread category is Alcoholism Vice or Disease my first of three conversations with Howard Fields MD PhD a senior researcher at the UCSFaffiliated Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and director of UCSFs Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction In third place is my story on the work of Mary Dallman PhD The Biology of Fat
    - What does this mean The most cynical among us might say that readers seem to be most interested in why they drink and what they eat and who can fix them up when addictions take their toll I prefer to believe that readers want answers and that they pardon the pun hunger for real experts
    - Biggest Science Caf surprise The success of the podcasts hands down At last count the number of Science Caf podcast downloads was nearly Thank you loyal listeners
    - Speaking of winners whatever happened to the best science website contest advertised on these pages Thanks to Scott Oakes MD from the Department of Pathology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Colin Fahrion from the Division of Pediatric Surgery for submitting their sites for consideration Both sites use the UCSF web banner correctly which in itself is worth applauding But our review of websites for the larger science community at UCSF revealed so many bad examples that we decided to hold the prize this year and roll it over to next season
    - Now heres something we should all rally behind maybe even stage at UCSF In an article in the Washington Post Matthew Chapman has thrown down the gauntlet to our long list of presidential candidates He has called for a presidential debate solely on the subject of science
    - As Chapman writes We must elect a president with a basic understanding of st century science He recommends that the debate not test arcane knowledge but general principles and deep thinking about what the scientific method means to the acquisition of knowledge I would be willing to moderate this debate for free
    - I have been saving these story links from the summer of Enjoy Heres a story on why we need to know more about the interaction between food and prescription drugs Heres another one about food Could taxes on foods that make us fat save lives Switching gears I pass along this link to a disturbing story about how the parasitic worm that causes river blindness is developing drug resistance This story has a UCSF angle James McKerrow MD PhD is working toward a new treatment for river blindness among other parasitic diseases

    title: "Family Trees: A Conversation with Physician-Scientist Esteban Burchard"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Do you know who you are
    - Many of us spend an entire lifetime trying to answer that question
    - Physicianscientists like UCSFs Esteban Burchard MD who operate more on a genetic than a psychological plane of existence cant wait that long
    - Why
    - Well people are different This is not as simple an answer as it seems
    - Esteban Burchard
    - Our genes help to determine how prone we are to certain diseases And the environment can be a trigger or a muzzle or sometimes both
    - Its a complex interplay and one that Burchard a native San Franciscan has dedicated himself to sorting out particularly when it comes to asthma and Latinos whose rates are high and climbing
    - The sortingout also extends to the very term Latino which encapsulates more than years of history waves of migration thousands of miles of geography and populations that mix European Native American and African gene pools
    - Not knowing who we are can have serious consequences for our health Some Latinos Puerto Ricans for example are far more likely to get asthma than others and react differently to the drugs used to treat it In short a drug that saves the life of one Latino could be useless in another
    - Understanding the genetics behind asthma risk not only helps asthma sufferers it also validates epidemiological and genetic approaches to other racially concentrated diseases such as multiple sclerosis which only strikes Caucasians or nonCaucasians who carry European genes
    - Far from daunted by the size of his research task Burchard is energized by it Indeed he calls his work complex and beautiful And he credits the career choice that brought him to this moment to the fish in San Francisco Bay

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Esteban Burchard assistant professor of biopaharmaceutical sciences and medicine in the UCSF school of pharmacy and the UCSF school of medicine Welcome Esteban
    - Esteban Burchard Thank you
    - Miller Can you define what biopharmaceutical sciences are please
    - Burchard well how I view it is its the enterplay with biology and drugs or pharmaceutical agents Our biggest focus is on how drugs differentially effect different populations based upon their genetics or pharmacogenetics
    - Miller Is this a new field
    - Burchard Pretty much very new
    - Miller Unique to UCSF
    - Burchard No but UCSF has a very strong track record and a very deep pool of talent here all focusing on pharmacogenetics
    - Miller I know you were trained as an epidemiologist but I dont know why you chose that field Could you tell me about that
    - Burchard Well my initial training was as a physicianscientist and so Ive always been trained with the interest of what we call translational research basically taking basic laboratory findings and applying them to patients or vice versa And as I got deeper and deeper into the field I recognized that I needed additional training which would allow me to explain why there differences in disease prevalence across populations or disease severity and thats why I went back and got additional training in biostatistics and epidemiology
    - Miller Does it ever work the other way people interested in epidemiology going back to get MD degrees
    - Burchard Yes but less so than the people going with MD degrees getting epidemiology degrees and I think its because being a physician scientist you are exposed to just a vast array of fascinating factoids differences in disease rates incidents prevalence everything and for some folks its a curiosity a drive for them to go back to school to get additional training to help explain why theyre seeing what theyre seeing
    - Miller Are physicianscientists a dying breed
    - Burchard Yes its pretty well documented in the US at least by the National Institutes of Health that the pool of physicianscientists is markedly going down And that is due to a variety of reasons A lot of it is economics a lot of it is the additional training that is required of physicianscientists a lot of it is a lack of incentives one can do much better in private practice than they will in academics pursuing science and medicine
    - Miller So a physicianscientists is clearly a person tied to an academic environment
    - Burchard Yes However theres been the development of several at the biotech companies like Genentech which is a great example where theyre doing very much cutting edge research Its very much an academic environment but now in the private sector
    - Miller Was there anyone in your family with a scientific background
    - Burchard No not at all
    - Miller Where did you grow up
    - Burchard Here in the Mission District San Francisco My mother was a migrant farm worker and taught her self English and went to college My father was a bluecollar person and got his highschool degree in his late sixties
    - Miller In his late sixties
    - Burchard Yes
    - Miller That must have been an inspiration
    - Burchard My Mom was the inspiration My parents divorced when I was very young and so I grew up in a singleparent household with five children I was taught very young to be very independent very hardworking I got my first job when I was nineyearsold working at a flea market and I just have been very independent ever since
    - Miller does that attitude reflect your career choice
    - Burchard My career choice is complicated I think to be honest that when I was very young my father would go to the shipyard bars and in order to go he would have to take me Id have to sit there for hours on end and I developed an interest in fishing Sitting for hours on end at the beach and watching the fish come by thats how my interest in science initially developed
    - I was fascinated by biological life marine biology in particular and in college I started off as a marine biology major Once I got into the science field I realized that there is a whole candy store sort of speak of scientific interests that I was now being exposed to and as I got deeper and deeper into it I switched majors to molecular biology and subsequently moved to medicine and Im STILL fascinated by it
    - In fact this past weekend I was at the Exploratorium and my wife was telling me how the kid came out of me I stayed there for eight hours doing all the little science experiments and looking up probabilities looking at all the harmonic synchronization everything about science came out and its just fascinating to me
    - Miller Do you suppose that first interest in marine biology is what might help explain your interest in the environmental impact and the interplay with genetic factors and disease
    - Burchard Definitely Definitely As I got into marine biology I quickly moved to molecular biology and that was the foundation for my exposure to genetics and as I got deeper and deeper into the field I recognized that it wasnt all genetic and I developed a strong appreciation for environmental factors
    - But then our own research just opened up my own eyes and impressed upon me how strong genetic as well as environmental factors were in the development of disease
    - Miller I know its hard to sometimes sort out which is which this interplay between genes and environment I know that you have a particular interest in asthma a chronic disease whose prevalence is increasing I know that its most common in Latinos of Puerto Rican dissent so do we know why that is and how did that first become known
    - Burchard This is really really cool Back in when I was a medical resident I was working in the laboratory of Jeff Drazen at Harvard med school and we first were looking for genes related to severity of asthma and we identified a genetic riskfactor that was associated with asthma severity in Caucasians and that riskfactor was almost twice as prevalent in AfricanAmericans
    - And this is important because AfricanAmericans have a very high asthmamortality rate so much more severe asthma than Caucasians so I postulated that perhaps genetic factors could help to explain some of the differences of severity of asthma
    - At the same time the Centers for Disease Control published a poster demonstrating that Hispanics and they lumped everyone together that Hispanics in the northeast had much much higher rates of asthma and much more severe asthma than any other population in the US And they also demonstrated that Hispanics in the west and the Southwest and the Midwest had low rates And being Hispanic myself having lived on both coasts the east coast and the west coast I quickly hypothesized the difference really was Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans
    - So we initiated at that time a study called The Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans to compare those two populations
    - Miller Now had anyone come to that conclusion before that it was Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans
    - Burchard No So we were the first to hypothesize it and we were funded to do the research and subsequent to that the Centers for Disease Control published a followup study to their initial paper demonstrating that it was indeed Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans But by that time we had already begun our study
    - Miller Now asthma rates are rising among all populations Do you care to speculate on why that might be
    - Burchard Well clearly it has to be environmental factors but there could also be an element of reporting biases perhaps were reporting it better than we were in the past but the rate of rise is so fast that itd be too fast for it to be explained by genetic differences
    - But we know that asthma runs in families we know that there is a very strong genetic component to asthma What intrigues me and what drives the basis of our research is that there are populationbased differences and we believe that genetics in part not entirely but in part may help to explain some of these differences
    - It is intriguing that the populations with the highest and lowest prevalence of asthma in the US and almost in the world are two Hispanic populations and that is intriguing because
    - Miller And which are those
    - Burchard Puerto Ricans have the highest prevalence and severity and deathrates and Mexicans have the lowest and everyone else in the United States falls in between there Its intriguing because Hispanics are a relatively young population created in when Christopher Columbus came to the New World theyre a combination of three ancestral groups Caucasian native American and African and the rich ancestry of Hispanic populations provides the intrinsic variability necessary to untangle genetic from environmental factors and thats one of the main reasons we are focusing on Hispanic populations And we could do this with other populations but this is the population we started with
    - Miller So you have to really understand patterns of history as well as science
    - Burchard Yes and thats the fascinating thing about what we do Its not just working with the test tubes or just seeing a patient its actually trying to understand different layers of complexity from environmental factors to historical factors to demographic factors to genetic ancestry then to understanding how drugs work in different people and different populations and so forth
    - Miller I want to get on the point the differences in how drugs work So in general I think I read someplace that a lot of massmarket drugs really only work on percent of the population theyre intended for So already we have a problem But then there are further problems that youre elucidating around ethnicity
    - Burchard Well we know that drugs work differently in different populations and the classic one that everyone knows about is alcohol In some populations particularly Asian populations who drink alcohol a lot of individuals of Asian background will turn red have facial flushing its an uncomfortable feeling and in other populations that wont happen and so if you equate alcohol to the drug youre having a differential effect in different populations
    - We know the same is true for some antihypertensive medications where they might work better in some Caucasians and work less effectively in African Americans and some drugs work better in AfricanAmericans versus Caucasians
    - Now there were even in the past in the recent past guidelines created to guide physicians on which drugs to use in which populations based on ethnic background Well race is a complex construct and is probably a proxy for a variety of factors social factors environmental factors but also genetic differences between populations And we believe some of these genetic differences may help to explain differences in drug response and thats what has been coined Pharmacogenetics
    - And in our own research weve demonstrated that when subjects of Puerto Rican background were compared to subjects of Mexican background Puerto Ricans by and large had much lower response to the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world which is Abuterol than Mexican children and that has significant implications because here you have a population that has the highest asthma prevalence they have the highest asthma death rates yet when Puerto Rican children reach for their inhaler they dont get the same bang for their buck as any other child And that in our view merits further exploration
    - And to date what we have subsequently identified is that there are genetic factors that helped explain some of the differences we saw in differences in drug response between these two populations
    - Miller And are there drugs that now exist that actually work better based on what youve learned
    - Burchard Yes from the GALA study we demonstrated that in Puerto Ricans there are drugs leuketrines For example work better in Puerto Ricans than Mexicans whereas inhaled coricol steroids and regular Albuterol work fine in Mexicans but not are as efficacious in Puerto Ricans
    - Miller You mentioned the GALA study which stands for Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans so how long has it been going on and in addition to what you just mentioned what other things have you learned
    - Burchard The GALA study started in when I was a medical resident at the Brigham womens hospital in Boston and subsequent to that I brought it to San Francisco I initiated it with the help of several people during that time Jeff Drazen Scott Weissman Ed Silverman and then I brought it to UCSF where we solicited the help of a variety of folks not only here at UCSF but at several of the other clinical centers where the GALA study was taking place Harlem Puerto Rico and Mexico city
    - Since coming to UCSF weve also initiated a study called SAGE a study of African Americans asthma genes and environments and thats a casecontrolled study of African American children with asthma here in the Bay Area
    - Miller So how many patients have you studied so far in the GALA study
    - Burchard It was a familybased study so in that study we recruited mom dad and asthmatic child We had a total of about families so thats at least individuals and we also had healthy controls from two of the sites So in total GALA consisted of about individuals And the SAGE study has people We have started recruitment for GALA and weve changed the name somewhat but its called Genes Environments and Admixture in Latino Asthmatics and the purpose of that study is to better characterize environmental factors as well as social factors which we believe may play a role in causing asthma or modifying asthma severity
    - Miller Is the GALA study a multi site study as well
    - Burchard Yes it is
    - Miller And what other sites are involved
    - Burchard Two sites in Puerto Rico on site in Harlem New York a site in Chicago a site in Houston Texas and the San Francisco Bay Area The GALA has five sites and also have SAGE going on which involves Kaiser of Northern California
    - Miller So the first GALA study is now complete so in addition to what you mentioned about the differential effect of drugs were there any other key findings
    - Burchard Weve identified several genetic risk factors that were present in one population and absent in another population weve identified gene environment interactions and thats fascinating because clearly the environments changing but now everyone develops asthma so what we demonstrated was that individuals who had a genetic risk factor and who were exposed to the right environmental challenge develop more severe asthma than individuals who either just had the environmental risk factor or the genetic risk factor
    - So really its a geneenvironment interaction almost like a twohit phenomenon It requires two risk factors to develop more severe disease than if you just had one alone
    - Miller Were there any surprises along the way maybe in some of the patients who selfidentify as a different ethnicity and the genetics showed otherwise
    - Burchard Yeah thats fascinating and thats one of the fascinating things about what we call admix populations populations that are a mixture of two or more ancestral groups In the US the classic groups are Hispanics or AfricanAmericans even Europeans to some extent have varying ancestral proportions from different European groups but Hispanics have been classified as almost a homogenous group or a monolithic group and a lot of our work has demonstrated using what we call forensic markers or ancestry informative markers that we can calculate the percentage of an individuals racial background and really categorize them based upon that
    - And so despite our best practice which was to only include subjects who selfidentified themselves their biological parents their biological grandparents as being percent pure either Mexican or Puerto Rican we saw a striking variation in the true racial composition of those individuals so we had Puerto Rican individuals who were percent European we had some that were percent African some that were a third European a third Native American and a third African Yet they all selfidentified as being Puerto Rican
    - And the same was true for Hispanics Clearly Puerto Ricans have more African ancestry than Mexicans do and Mexicans have more Native American ancestry than Puerto Ricans do yet their all classified as being Hispanic and we believe that its this intrinsic variability genetic variability that we can use to help disentangle genetic from environmental risk factors that may be generalizable to all populations
    - Miller So do you suppose an offshoot of this will be to actually be able to identify what a native Puerto Rican actually looks like genetically Is it possible to do that or is it even worthwhile
    - Burchard Well each of those individuals that were put in our study will tell you they are native Puerto Ricans and so thats part of being Puerto Rican Youre a mixture of three ancestral groups by and large and there have been subsequent waves of migration that probably led to the increasing complexity where there are individuals who probably have Indian or East Asian ancestry and ancestors from all over the world that are Puerto Ricans
    - Thats the complexity but its also the beauty of it its hard to put down what it means to be truly Hispanic Clearly theres a social component but as well theres a genetic or biological component
    - Miller Do you suppose theres some general principles you will have learned that might help explain for example why Scottish people have the highest rates of MS in the world
    - Burchard Were still on the hunt for genetic risk factors that help to explain differences in multiple sclerosis or MS but what is fascinating is that one can use racially mixed populations to help identify new genetic risk factors and one of the best examples of this is done here at UCSF by Steve Hausers group and Jorge Oxenburg and they initiated a study based on the premise that its well known that only Caucasians develop multiple sclerosis it happens in no other group than Caucasians However in the US it does happen in African Americans
    - Also in the US African Americans are on average percent African and percent European so if you go on the presumption that its due to a European genetic risk factor all those African Americans who have MS presumably inherited the European genetic risk factor So they paired up with Montel Williams and got on the Montel Williams talk show Steve Hauser did and made a plea to the African America community that if you have Multiple Sclerosis send your DNA to UCSF
    - And by using these genetic risk markers that can differentiate African from European they were able to exploit the variation within the African American population to identify novel never discovered before genetic risk factors for multiple sclerosis that will be a benefit to all populations whether Caucasian or African American populations that suffer from Multiple Sclerosis So that is a perfect example of how one can use the rich variation in genetic ancestry or the history of a population to uncover novel risk factors that are generalizable to all populations
    - Miller Lets get back to environmental containments for a moment Lets say just say that we were able to identify that theres some increase in particulate matter that was related to the increased prevalence of asthma among all populations Would we be able to do anything about it How do we take that information and move it into the policy arena
    - Burchard Well clearly if we determine that there are environmental factors such as secondhand smoke that differentially effect some populations more severely than other populations we can use that information to set environmental thresholds on where we set the bar for allowing either secondhand smoke or places where we allow secondhand smoke or acceptable levels for a given population
    - One of my graduate students by the name of Max Seibold has demonstrated that there are genetic variants in a gene that metabolizes one of the most common environmental challenges which is called chitin He demonstrated that individuals that had a genetic variation in this gene that had a hyperactive enzyme were better able at metabolizing or chewing up the environmental chitin versus those individuals that didnt have this mutation
    - Whats interesting is that the new surge in antimicrobial soaps or antibiotics has basically depleted one of the best metabolizers of chitin which is bacteria And so this sort of research may put a break sort of speak on what we determine as being acceptable behavior spraying everything with antimicrobials before we touch it may actually be causing or contributing to the increased development of asthma so we may have a second thought before we apply the antimicrobials
    - Miller This is the so called hygiene hypothesis we dont play in the dirt anymore
    - Burchard Thats right As physicians weve already changed our practices whereas before we might have been very quick to prescribe antibiotics to children who had upper respiratory tract infections or URIs we now have a second thought because we know that URIs down the road actually confer some sort of protection against the development of not only asthma but other immunologic disorders
    - So we recognize that its a clear symbiotic relationship between us and our ambient environment and the ambient microbes that exists within our environment
    - Miller Estaban thank you so much youve given us so much to think about
    - Burchard Thank you its been an honor to be here

    title: "Family Trees: A Conversation with Physician-Scientist Esteban Burchard"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Do you know who you are
    - Many of us spend an entire lifetime trying to answer that question
    - Physicianscientists like UCSFs Esteban Burchard MD who operate more on a genetic than a psychological plane of existence cant wait that long
    - Why
    - Well people are different This is not as simple an answer as it seems
    - Esteban Burchard
    - Our genes help to determine how prone we are to certain diseases And the environment can be a trigger or a muzzle or sometimes both
    - Its a complex interplay and one that Burchard a native San Franciscan has dedicated himself to sorting out particularly when it comes to asthma and Latinos whose rates are high and climbing
    - The sortingout also extends to the very term Latino which encapsulates more than years of history waves of migration thousands of miles of geography and populations that mix European Native American and African gene pools
    - Not knowing who we are can have serious consequences for our health Some Latinos Puerto Ricans for example are far more likely to get asthma than others and react differently to the drugs used to treat it In short a drug that saves the life of one Latino could be useless in another
    - Understanding the genetics behind asthma risk not only helps asthma sufferers it also validates epidemiological and genetic approaches to other racially concentrated diseases such as multiple sclerosis which only strikes Caucasians or nonCaucasians who carry European genes
    - Far from daunted by the size of his research task Burchard is energized by it Indeed he calls his work complex and beautiful And he credits the career choice that brought him to this moment to the fish in San Francisco Bay

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Esteban Burchard assistant professor of biopaharmaceutical sciences and medicine in the UCSF school of pharmacy and the UCSF school of medicine Welcome Esteban
    - Esteban Burchard Thank you
    - Miller Can you define what biopharmaceutical sciences are please
    - Burchard well how I view it is its the enterplay with biology and drugs or pharmaceutical agents Our biggest focus is on how drugs differentially effect different populations based upon their genetics or pharmacogenetics
    - Miller Is this a new field
    - Burchard Pretty much very new
    - Miller Unique to UCSF
    - Burchard No but UCSF has a very strong track record and a very deep pool of talent here all focusing on pharmacogenetics
    - Miller I know you were trained as an epidemiologist but I dont know why you chose that field Could you tell me about that
    - Burchard Well my initial training was as a physicianscientist and so Ive always been trained with the interest of what we call translational research basically taking basic laboratory findings and applying them to patients or vice versa And as I got deeper and deeper into the field I recognized that I needed additional training which would allow me to explain why there differences in disease prevalence across populations or disease severity and thats why I went back and got additional training in biostatistics and epidemiology
    - Miller Does it ever work the other way people interested in epidemiology going back to get MD degrees
    - Burchard Yes but less so than the people going with MD degrees getting epidemiology degrees and I think its because being a physician scientist you are exposed to just a vast array of fascinating factoids differences in disease rates incidents prevalence everything and for some folks its a curiosity a drive for them to go back to school to get additional training to help explain why theyre seeing what theyre seeing
    - Miller Are physicianscientists a dying breed
    - Burchard Yes its pretty well documented in the US at least by the National Institutes of Health that the pool of physicianscientists is markedly going down And that is due to a variety of reasons A lot of it is economics a lot of it is the additional training that is required of physicianscientists a lot of it is a lack of incentives one can do much better in private practice than they will in academics pursuing science and medicine
    - Miller So a physicianscientists is clearly a person tied to an academic environment
    - Burchard Yes However theres been the development of several at the biotech companies like Genentech which is a great example where theyre doing very much cutting edge research Its very much an academic environment but now in the private sector
    - Miller Was there anyone in your family with a scientific background
    - Burchard No not at all
    - Miller Where did you grow up
    - Burchard Here in the Mission District San Francisco My mother was a migrant farm worker and taught her self English and went to college My father was a bluecollar person and got his highschool degree in his late sixties
    - Miller In his late sixties
    - Burchard Yes
    - Miller That must have been an inspiration
    - Burchard My Mom was the inspiration My parents divorced when I was very young and so I grew up in a singleparent household with five children I was taught very young to be very independent very hardworking I got my first job when I was nineyearsold working at a flea market and I just have been very independent ever since
    - Miller does that attitude reflect your career choice
    - Burchard My career choice is complicated I think to be honest that when I was very young my father would go to the shipyard bars and in order to go he would have to take me Id have to sit there for hours on end and I developed an interest in fishing Sitting for hours on end at the beach and watching the fish come by thats how my interest in science initially developed
    - I was fascinated by biological life marine biology in particular and in college I started off as a marine biology major Once I got into the science field I realized that there is a whole candy store sort of speak of scientific interests that I was now being exposed to and as I got deeper and deeper into it I switched majors to molecular biology and subsequently moved to medicine and Im STILL fascinated by it
    - In fact this past weekend I was at the Exploratorium and my wife was telling me how the kid came out of me I stayed there for eight hours doing all the little science experiments and looking up probabilities looking at all the harmonic synchronization everything about science came out and its just fascinating to me
    - Miller Do you suppose that first interest in marine biology is what might help explain your interest in the environmental impact and the interplay with genetic factors and disease
    - Burchard Definitely Definitely As I got into marine biology I quickly moved to molecular biology and that was the foundation for my exposure to genetics and as I got deeper and deeper into the field I recognized that it wasnt all genetic and I developed a strong appreciation for environmental factors
    - But then our own research just opened up my own eyes and impressed upon me how strong genetic as well as environmental factors were in the development of disease
    - Miller I know its hard to sometimes sort out which is which this interplay between genes and environment I know that you have a particular interest in asthma a chronic disease whose prevalence is increasing I know that its most common in Latinos of Puerto Rican dissent so do we know why that is and how did that first become known
    - Burchard This is really really cool Back in when I was a medical resident I was working in the laboratory of Jeff Drazen at Harvard med school and we first were looking for genes related to severity of asthma and we identified a genetic riskfactor that was associated with asthma severity in Caucasians and that riskfactor was almost twice as prevalent in AfricanAmericans
    - And this is important because AfricanAmericans have a very high asthmamortality rate so much more severe asthma than Caucasians so I postulated that perhaps genetic factors could help to explain some of the differences of severity of asthma
    - At the same time the Centers for Disease Control published a poster demonstrating that Hispanics and they lumped everyone together that Hispanics in the northeast had much much higher rates of asthma and much more severe asthma than any other population in the US And they also demonstrated that Hispanics in the west and the Southwest and the Midwest had low rates And being Hispanic myself having lived on both coasts the east coast and the west coast I quickly hypothesized the difference really was Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans
    - So we initiated at that time a study called The Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans to compare those two populations
    - Miller Now had anyone come to that conclusion before that it was Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans
    - Burchard No So we were the first to hypothesize it and we were funded to do the research and subsequent to that the Centers for Disease Control published a followup study to their initial paper demonstrating that it was indeed Puerto Ricans versus Mexicans But by that time we had already begun our study
    - Miller Now asthma rates are rising among all populations Do you care to speculate on why that might be
    - Burchard Well clearly it has to be environmental factors but there could also be an element of reporting biases perhaps were reporting it better than we were in the past but the rate of rise is so fast that itd be too fast for it to be explained by genetic differences
    - But we know that asthma runs in families we know that there is a very strong genetic component to asthma What intrigues me and what drives the basis of our research is that there are populationbased differences and we believe that genetics in part not entirely but in part may help to explain some of these differences
    - It is intriguing that the populations with the highest and lowest prevalence of asthma in the US and almost in the world are two Hispanic populations and that is intriguing because
    - Miller And which are those
    - Burchard Puerto Ricans have the highest prevalence and severity and deathrates and Mexicans have the lowest and everyone else in the United States falls in between there Its intriguing because Hispanics are a relatively young population created in when Christopher Columbus came to the New World theyre a combination of three ancestral groups Caucasian native American and African and the rich ancestry of Hispanic populations provides the intrinsic variability necessary to untangle genetic from environmental factors and thats one of the main reasons we are focusing on Hispanic populations And we could do this with other populations but this is the population we started with
    - Miller So you have to really understand patterns of history as well as science
    - Burchard Yes and thats the fascinating thing about what we do Its not just working with the test tubes or just seeing a patient its actually trying to understand different layers of complexity from environmental factors to historical factors to demographic factors to genetic ancestry then to understanding how drugs work in different people and different populations and so forth
    - Miller I want to get on the point the differences in how drugs work So in general I think I read someplace that a lot of massmarket drugs really only work on percent of the population theyre intended for So already we have a problem But then there are further problems that youre elucidating around ethnicity
    - Burchard Well we know that drugs work differently in different populations and the classic one that everyone knows about is alcohol In some populations particularly Asian populations who drink alcohol a lot of individuals of Asian background will turn red have facial flushing its an uncomfortable feeling and in other populations that wont happen and so if you equate alcohol to the drug youre having a differential effect in different populations
    - We know the same is true for some antihypertensive medications where they might work better in some Caucasians and work less effectively in African Americans and some drugs work better in AfricanAmericans versus Caucasians
    - Now there were even in the past in the recent past guidelines created to guide physicians on which drugs to use in which populations based on ethnic background Well race is a complex construct and is probably a proxy for a variety of factors social factors environmental factors but also genetic differences between populations And we believe some of these genetic differences may help to explain differences in drug response and thats what has been coined Pharmacogenetics
    - And in our own research weve demonstrated that when subjects of Puerto Rican background were compared to subjects of Mexican background Puerto Ricans by and large had much lower response to the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world which is Abuterol than Mexican children and that has significant implications because here you have a population that has the highest asthma prevalence they have the highest asthma death rates yet when Puerto Rican children reach for their inhaler they dont get the same bang for their buck as any other child And that in our view merits further exploration
    - And to date what we have subsequently identified is that there are genetic factors that helped explain some of the differences we saw in differences in drug response between these two populations
    - Miller And are there drugs that now exist that actually work better based on what youve learned
    - Burchard Yes from the GALA study we demonstrated that in Puerto Ricans there are drugs leuketrines For example work better in Puerto Ricans than Mexicans whereas inhaled coricol steroids and regular Albuterol work fine in Mexicans but not are as efficacious in Puerto Ricans
    - Miller You mentioned the GALA study which stands for Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans so how long has it been going on and in addition to what you just mentioned what other things have you learned
    - Burchard The GALA study started in when I was a medical resident at the Brigham womens hospital in Boston and subsequent to that I brought it to San Francisco I initiated it with the help of several people during that time Jeff Drazen Scott Weissman Ed Silverman and then I brought it to UCSF where we solicited the help of a variety of folks not only here at UCSF but at several of the other clinical centers where the GALA study was taking place Harlem Puerto Rico and Mexico city
    - Since coming to UCSF weve also initiated a study called SAGE a study of African Americans asthma genes and environments and thats a casecontrolled study of African American children with asthma here in the Bay Area
    - Miller So how many patients have you studied so far in the GALA study
    - Burchard It was a familybased study so in that study we recruited mom dad and asthmatic child We had a total of about families so thats at least individuals and we also had healthy controls from two of the sites So in total GALA consisted of about individuals And the SAGE study has people We have started recruitment for GALA and weve changed the name somewhat but its called Genes Environments and Admixture in Latino Asthmatics and the purpose of that study is to better characterize environmental factors as well as social factors which we believe may play a role in causing asthma or modifying asthma severity
    - Miller Is the GALA study a multi site study as well
    - Burchard Yes it is
    - Miller And what other sites are involved
    - Burchard Two sites in Puerto Rico on site in Harlem New York a site in Chicago a site in Houston Texas and the San Francisco Bay Area The GALA has five sites and also have SAGE going on which involves Kaiser of Northern California
    - Miller So the first GALA study is now complete so in addition to what you mentioned about the differential effect of drugs were there any other key findings
    - Burchard Weve identified several genetic risk factors that were present in one population and absent in another population weve identified gene environment interactions and thats fascinating because clearly the environments changing but now everyone develops asthma so what we demonstrated was that individuals who had a genetic risk factor and who were exposed to the right environmental challenge develop more severe asthma than individuals who either just had the environmental risk factor or the genetic risk factor
    - So really its a geneenvironment interaction almost like a twohit phenomenon It requires two risk factors to develop more severe disease than if you just had one alone
    - Miller Were there any surprises along the way maybe in some of the patients who selfidentify as a different ethnicity and the genetics showed otherwise
    - Burchard Yeah thats fascinating and thats one of the fascinating things about what we call admix populations populations that are a mixture of two or more ancestral groups In the US the classic groups are Hispanics or AfricanAmericans even Europeans to some extent have varying ancestral proportions from different European groups but Hispanics have been classified as almost a homogenous group or a monolithic group and a lot of our work has demonstrated using what we call forensic markers or ancestry informative markers that we can calculate the percentage of an individuals racial background and really categorize them based upon that
    - And so despite our best practice which was to only include subjects who selfidentified themselves their biological parents their biological grandparents as being percent pure either Mexican or Puerto Rican we saw a striking variation in the true racial composition of those individuals so we had Puerto Rican individuals who were percent European we had some that were percent African some that were a third European a third Native American and a third African Yet they all selfidentified as being Puerto Rican
    - And the same was true for Hispanics Clearly Puerto Ricans have more African ancestry than Mexicans do and Mexicans have more Native American ancestry than Puerto Ricans do yet their all classified as being Hispanic and we believe that its this intrinsic variability genetic variability that we can use to help disentangle genetic from environmental risk factors that may be generalizable to all populations
    - Miller So do you suppose an offshoot of this will be to actually be able to identify what a native Puerto Rican actually looks like genetically Is it possible to do that or is it even worthwhile
    - Burchard Well each of those individuals that were put in our study will tell you they are native Puerto Ricans and so thats part of being Puerto Rican Youre a mixture of three ancestral groups by and large and there have been subsequent waves of migration that probably led to the increasing complexity where there are individuals who probably have Indian or East Asian ancestry and ancestors from all over the world that are Puerto Ricans
    - Thats the complexity but its also the beauty of it its hard to put down what it means to be truly Hispanic Clearly theres a social component but as well theres a genetic or biological component
    - Miller Do you suppose theres some general principles you will have learned that might help explain for example why Scottish people have the highest rates of MS in the world
    - Burchard Were still on the hunt for genetic risk factors that help to explain differences in multiple sclerosis or MS but what is fascinating is that one can use racially mixed populations to help identify new genetic risk factors and one of the best examples of this is done here at UCSF by Steve Hausers group and Jorge Oxenburg and they initiated a study based on the premise that its well known that only Caucasians develop multiple sclerosis it happens in no other group than Caucasians However in the US it does happen in African Americans
    - Also in the US African Americans are on average percent African and percent European so if you go on the presumption that its due to a European genetic risk factor all those African Americans who have MS presumably inherited the European genetic risk factor So they paired up with Montel Williams and got on the Montel Williams talk show Steve Hauser did and made a plea to the African America community that if you have Multiple Sclerosis send your DNA to UCSF
    - And by using these genetic risk markers that can differentiate African from European they were able to exploit the variation within the African American population to identify novel never discovered before genetic risk factors for multiple sclerosis that will be a benefit to all populations whether Caucasian or African American populations that suffer from Multiple Sclerosis So that is a perfect example of how one can use the rich variation in genetic ancestry or the history of a population to uncover novel risk factors that are generalizable to all populations
    - Miller Lets get back to environmental containments for a moment Lets say just say that we were able to identify that theres some increase in particulate matter that was related to the increased prevalence of asthma among all populations Would we be able to do anything about it How do we take that information and move it into the policy arena
    - Burchard Well clearly if we determine that there are environmental factors such as secondhand smoke that differentially effect some populations more severely than other populations we can use that information to set environmental thresholds on where we set the bar for allowing either secondhand smoke or places where we allow secondhand smoke or acceptable levels for a given population
    - One of my graduate students by the name of Max Seibold has demonstrated that there are genetic variants in a gene that metabolizes one of the most common environmental challenges which is called chitin He demonstrated that individuals that had a genetic variation in this gene that had a hyperactive enzyme were better able at metabolizing or chewing up the environmental chitin versus those individuals that didnt have this mutation
    - Whats interesting is that the new surge in antimicrobial soaps or antibiotics has basically depleted one of the best metabolizers of chitin which is bacteria And so this sort of research may put a break sort of speak on what we determine as being acceptable behavior spraying everything with antimicrobials before we touch it may actually be causing or contributing to the increased development of asthma so we may have a second thought before we apply the antimicrobials
    - Miller This is the so called hygiene hypothesis we dont play in the dirt anymore
    - Burchard Thats right As physicians weve already changed our practices whereas before we might have been very quick to prescribe antibiotics to children who had upper respiratory tract infections or URIs we now have a second thought because we know that URIs down the road actually confer some sort of protection against the development of not only asthma but other immunologic disorders
    - So we recognize that its a clear symbiotic relationship between us and our ambient environment and the ambient microbes that exists within our environment
    - Miller Estaban thank you so much youve given us so much to think about
    - Burchard Thank you its been an honor to be here

    title: "Health in the Time of Poison: A Conversation with Reproductive Health Expert Tracey Woodruff, PhD"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Tracey Woodruff
    - Anyone familiar with clinical trials understands the extraordinary lengths taken in testing new drugs to determine that they are both safe and effective
    - We also know by cruel example that these safeguards sometimes fail
    - When they do there is always a great hue and cry and a lot of finger pointing about who is most to blame for these unwanted risks to human health
    - Why then I ask is there not similar outrage about the chemicals released into our environment many of them in the last years which pose a clear threat to human health and which continue to amass and multiply in staggering amounts without proper testing or oversight
    - From the increase in male genital abnormalities at birth to the early onset of puberty in girls and from the declining levels of testosterone to the rising rates of breast cancer chemicals like bisphenol A phthalates PCBs and PBDEs are leaving their nasty mark on humanity Indeed there is increasing evidence that the effects of certain chemicals are being passed on to our grandchildren
    - How is that for a genetic legacy to make our ancestors proud
    - Tracey Woodruff PhD director of UCSFs Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment part of UCSFs National Center of Excellence in Womens Health understands these threats all too well Woodruff who worked in the Office of Policy Economics and Innovation at the federal Environmental Protection Agency before coming to UCSF is an expert on the impact of chemicals on reproductive health in both men and women She has a particular interest in the effects of air pollution on children
    - But it is the wider public interest on which she has now set her sights The truth is that pertinent information information that might energize the public and policymakers alike lives isolated in the worlds of basic science environmental science and health policy Woodruffs role is to ferret out combine educate translate and bring the science into the public eye and into the clinic where it can do the most good
    - They say the truth will set you free In this case it might save us all

    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Im here today with Tracey Woodruff director of the program on reproductive health and the environment and an associate professor in residence at the department of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at UCSF Welcome Tracy
    - Woodruff Thank you Jeff
    - Miller Now reproductive sciences that has a certain Orwellian ring to it can you explain what that is or what they are
    - Woodruff Well what were interested in in terms of reproductive sciences is really all those pieces that go along with our ability to reproduce Essentially our ability to get pregnant ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and have a healthy childhood and then those parts that go along with having the ability again to reproduce later So all those things like being able to have a healthy reproductive system So ability to get pregnant ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and then look at issues related to those pieces that are related to reproductive function later
    - When you go through puberty there are certain parts of the body that change Women develop breasts they develop the ability to menstruate their ovaries start to function normally so that they can reproduce later in life Reproductive issues can occur in any of those parts of the body later on in life for women Similarly with men their ability to reproduce in terms of normally functioning penis and testicles and their ability to have normal sperm counts and later reproduce
    - Miller Is this a field that is common at other research universities or is it something particular to UCSF
    - Woodruff In terms of reproductive sciences any department of obstetrics and gynecology would be concerned about all these particular issues that cover reproductive health in terms of ability to conceive ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and then subsequent functioning of the different reproductive systems in men and women Whats unique about the program at UCSF is our focus on how environmental contaminants can interfere with each of those different stages during the life course and affect the ability of people to either have a healthy child or have problems in their reproductive system later in life
    - Miller So was there a moment in your career maybe even in your childhood when you first became interested in science
    - Woodruff I actually come from a background in engineering and that was somewhat inherited from my own father who was trained in engineering and Ive always been interested in math and science as a child I actually have a undergraduate degree in electrical engineering but when I was an undergraduate I wanted to do something that was a little broader and I was very captured with issues relating to the environment
    - I actually went to get my PhD at a joint program between UCSF and UC Berkeley in bioengineering which at the time was quite small and now is actually a whole department at each of the universities And then I sort of moved into the field of human health I went from engineering and then became interested in this idea about well how can I work in a field that really is both looking at the impacts on human health and help improve human health I became very interested in how the environment may be playing a role in impacting human health And thats a little bit of my trajectory
    - Miller So did you build bridges with toys as a young girl
    - Woodruff Im trying to remember I was a tomboy yeah I was very interested in building things I built a lot of models of ships and cars and things
    - Miller Did you ever feel discriminated against as a young girl growing up for liking math and science sometimes we hear that that is still the case today
    - Woodruff No I didnt feel like people gave me a hard time because I liked math and science I do remember my mother buying me a chemistry set when I was probably about ten that said growing boys toy and we thought it was kind of funny at that time but when I look back on it that was obviously not appropriate
    - When I grew up it was also the emergence of the feminist movement during the Seventies and so I think there was a lot of recognition about the potential of women and encouraging them to go into different types of fields like math and science so you know its interesting to sort of think back now looking at todays young women and whether theyre still being equally encouraged but certainly gender issues in toys still remained
    - Miller Were there a lot of women working at the EPA I know thats where you were before you came to UCSF so could you tell me what you were doing at that famed institution
    - Woodruff I spent years at the US Environmental Protection Agency I was there for both the Clinton and Bush administrations and while I was at EPA I had a very unique and interesting job
    - I worked in whats loosely called the office of policy And the office of policy is a part of EPA that essentially both intersects with looking at how EPA does their regulations and also provides advice on different kinds of aspects related to policy development at the US national level And my job was a little bit unique because I was able to both participate in original studies I did a lot of work on issues related to air pollution And develop information to access the levels of air pollution outside and then look at the impacts of air pollution particularly on perinatal health
    - I also got very interested in issues related to child development During that time during the early part of the Clinton years and following into the Bush years there was a growing recognition push on at the agency to really focus on these issues about how environmental contaminants can affect early development A lot of science shows that when the developing organism is exposed to environmental contaminants that exposure can represent a greater time of susceptibility compared to exposures as an adult
    - So the science in this area is much more robust but at the time back in the s it wasnt very well integrated into the thinking of EPA about how do we both advance the science in terms of exposures during life and revealing what those susceptibilities might be and then what does that mean in terms of the kind of policies and regulations we do in terms of trying to make sure we protect the whole public
    - So some of the areas that I also was able to work on that sort of intersected in that was looking at how policies that EPA sets in terms of national guidelines on how they think about environmental contaminants I participated in a lot of those in terms of both writing guidelines advising the upper management at EPA about things that they should do in order to develop policies that protect children better and also develop tools analytic tools that policy makers could use to try and monitor trends in environmental factors that may be important for kids environmental health
    - Miller I have to ask this question were you ever concerned about the liability issues as you were uncovering more information about what industries or what chemicals might be doing what to whom and when
    - Woodruff Well you mean in terms of me personally being sued
    - Miller No but in terms of the kinds of industries that might be implicated as the source of some these chemicals
    - Woodruff When you work at the US Environmental Protection Agency you are very familiar with all the industries who are concerned about the implications about what EPA is doing for their work Because its a community that is obviously impacted by the types of decisions EPA makes So they make a point of coming to visit or sending their concerns to EPA So yes we interacted with them often on different types of issues
    - Miller Now you have moved from a government institution to an academic institution Why UCSF
    - Woodruff UCSF represents a very unique and interesting opportunity in terms of looking at issues related to environmental health UCSF is obviously a premier medical school a medical institution that offers professional health training in medicine dentistry and nursing
    - Miller And pharmacy
    - Woodruff And pharmacy And pharmacys actually very important because they have a whole program that deals with looking at toxicology But the thing thats very interesting about UCSF in terms of both having a very premier professional school and also very high calibre research in the basic sciences is that theres really very little going on in terms of the intersection between the issues that theyre concerned about which primarily relate to human health and environmental contaminants So the broader theme is that a lot of people work in the health sciences and theyre a group of people who do work in environmental health sciences but theres not very good intersection between the two even though each field could benefit greatly from looking at what each other is doing
    - For example some of the things we know from pharmaceutical drugs and how they affect young children is very pertinent to what EPA or other agencies or policy people are thinking about in terms of looking at the impacts of environmental contaminants on development So coming to UCSF represents a really unique opportunity to engage with basic scientists and clinicians and other healthcare providers who have a different set of pieces of information about human health and development that can be very informative to thinking about how can environmental contaminants play in terms of impacting human health and development
    - Miller So I see a bridge here your engineering background bridging a gap
    - Woodruff laughter
    - Miller If youll indulge me for a second about twenty years ago I was in a car ride with one of UCSFs experts on occupational health and we were doing a story on human health impacts of a toxic waste dump He told me then that humans were part of this unwitting experiment on themselves that there were tens of thousands of chemicals being released into the environment and we had no idea of what the potential environmental impacts were
    - Now flash forward twenty years later Im sitting here across from you I read about reports on these Artic villages where twice as many girls as boys are being born because of environmental contaminants I was alarmed twenty years ago should I be panicked now What exactly is going on what is the scope of this story
    - Woodruff Well first of all you shouldnt panic I mean obviously there is an issue for concern One of the things thats very interesting in working in this field particularly when I talk to other people about my job Im like oh Im really interested in environmental contaminants and how they impact either prenatal health or child health and then you start to talk about it just like you had this experience in the car you talk to parents and they say well there werent kids with peanut allergies when I was a kid and now lots of kids have severe peanut allergies
    - Kids didnt really have asthma and now asthma is much more prevalent than is used to be more kids appear to have neurodevelopmental disabilities increases in autism or attention deficit disorder Then you marry that with what we know from data that being collected nationally from the CDC that shows that everybody carries with them a load of environmental contaminants Whether its lead or mercury new studies have come out about bistinalay and phthalates when you talk about these things then people say oh youre job is a little bit depressing and how do you not just wanna go and put yourself in a bubble and hide I think the thing thats important to remember is yes we have challenges ahead of us we need to keep working on but we also have examples of success in the past where weve actually been able to reduce the impact of environmental contaminants primarily through actions that happen at a broad level
    - For example when I was growing up there was lead in gasoline There is no more lead in gasoline in the United States And thats because EPA took the lead out of gasoline in the s
    - Miller The lead thats showing up in our body burden counts wheres that coming from
    - Woodruff Well some of the lead thats showing up is theres sort of trace amounts left theres still some places for example that lead smelters in the US that are still in operation theres a concern now with lead in some consumer products that sort of popped up because the whole globalization of trade You heard about the lead in the toys so we both can successfully get rid of things but we also have to keep vigilant about keeping things out of contact to the human health
    - So lead was a very great example Body burdens of lead that we thought were unachievable back in the seventies we now have levels that are extraordinarily low compared to what they were in the seventies And recently youll see for example in the state of California the governor signed a bill to remove phthalates from toys Well when those phthalates are removed from toys Im sure youll see that the levels of phthalates in children will drop and as we start to march towards and look at other sources of some of these contaminants that are ubiquitous and we look at interventions that can actually remove them from exposures to the public we can be successful in terms of reducing that burden from environmental contaminants
    - Miller You mentioned earlier when we were talking about the development of human organism and I guess theres a particular class of chemicals the endocrinedisrupting chemicals
    - Woodruff Yes
    - Miller that have a particular impact so could you describe what they can do and at certain critical stages
    - Woodruff So there is a concern and this has been emerging over Id say roughly the last twenty years through both scientific experimentation and communication of the science to the public about chemicals which have the ability to mimic naturally occurring hormones in the body So chemicals that can act like estrogen or chemicals that can act like testosterone or chemicals that can interfere with the production of estrogen or testosterone And if those chemicals do that in the body the hormones which are part of change at certain levels during development and are part of the natural development of the reproductive organs If you interfere with those then they can have long downstream consequences in terms of health effects
    - So for example when a male boy is developing in utero their levels of testosterone can change dramatically they go from very low to almost adult levels and then back down again because testosterone is a very important part of the development of the penis and the descendance of the testicles So that when the baby boy is born he has a normal set of reproductive organs
    - Now animal experiments have shown that if you expose a animals to phthalates which basically reduce levels of testosterone you can actually inhibit the normal development both of the penis and the testicles resulting in what we call Hypospadias which is incomplete formation of the penis cryptorganism which is undescended testicles or you can have even more subtle markers of incomplete male development for example there is a measure of the distance from the anus to the genitals called anogenital distance which is a fairly standard measure that toxicologists use to measure complete development of the reproductive organs in the male
    - Exposure to phthalates can also reduce that distance thereby an indicator that the male reproductive organs have not completely developed
    - Miller Is there any indication that the rates of these problems are rising
    - Woodruff Yes the data suggests that there has been increases in Hypospadias and Cryptorchidism there is data in certain areas showing that sort of downstream events which are reduction in sperm viability whether its damaged sperm low sperm count etc which can lead to infertility there have been studies suggesting that theres been decreases in sperm in certain populations And there was a very interesting study that came out recently showing that testosterone levels have declined It was from a cohort study in Massachusetts basically showing that men measured at the same age their testosterone levels from ten or years ago compared to today have lower testosterone same age then they did about sooddyearsago
    - And we also know that theres been an increase in rates of testicular cancer And thats gone up about in white men over the last years which is also related to this issue about effects in utero from exposure to has been shown to be related through animal studies from exposure to environmental contaminants
    - Miller OK weve talked about males how about females What would be some of the impacts
    - Woodruff Well I have to say the area of female reproductive health is not as well studied
    - Miller A gender bias
    - Woodruff Laughter A gender bias a new agenda Though theres been a lot of studies about breast cancer which is considered in the family of reproductive health problems for women What some studies have shown is that exposure to some of these endocrine destructing chemicals before birth can predispose the mammary cells to be more likely to generate into a breast cancer
    - We do know from animal studies that also exposures during puberty are very important You mentioned the windows of susceptibility basically the windows of susceptibility are those times primarily during development when there are great changes occurring in the body And those times of great change can also present opportunities of increased risk from exposure to environmental contaminants
    - So during puberty as we talked about earlier there are certain changes going on in particular areas of the body Young girls are developing breasts during puberty Well that also represents a time of increased susceptibility to environmental contaminants So there are for example animal studies showing that exposure to chemicals which can damage DNA can cause a higher rate of breast cancer in animals that are exposed during puberty than even if theyre exposed when they are younger or older
    - Miller And is the onset of puberty coming at an earlier age for women
    - Woodruff Yes the issue about the onset of puberty is something that is of growing concern There have been starting probably about in the mid s studies documenting that the age of onset of particular parts of puberty appear to be going down There are three pieces of puberty theres breast development theres pubic hair and then theres menarche which is the start of the menstrual cycle And the data suggests that the age of thelarche breast development has gone down The age of menarche does not appear to be changing too much
    - Miller So could we put some years on this it was now its or it was now
    - Woodruff Id have to check exactly but there are definitely reports showing that girls as young as six or seven can be beginning to start puberty
    - Miller And that would have been considered at one time extremely rare but now more common
    - Woodruff More common right
    - Miller Something else that I read in your reports also struck me We ve talked about some clearly defined problems in male genitalia at birth or something but that there are these more insidious facts in a way that show up later in adulthood and these things may set you up for lets say increased rates of particular kinds of cancer
    - Woodruff Right
    - Woodruff Yeah Its interesting because some of these studies go all the way back to some of their initial concerns about this were raised during the DES episode So DES is Diethyl it was a drug that was given to women back in the s s with the idea that it would prevent miscarriages which it did not Subsequently the daughters of the mothers who were taking this drug developed a very rare form of vaginal cancer Even though the moms themselves suffered no adverse consequences Basically providing the very tragic but key information that exposures in the womb could manifest themselves in outcomes that dont occur until the offspring are much older Essentially the daughters were older in their s or older when they got these rare forms of vaginal cancers and since those studies have come up a lot of different other types of reproductive health outcomes have been tied to prenatal exposure to DES
    - And now what were seeing is that it affects their childrens ability to both have another child and then it can also pass on to their children And theres a very nice set of studies done by Pat Hunt up at the Washington State in Pullman showing that exposure to bisphenol A in the womb can affect essentially the developing eggs of that moms daughter that would be her subsequent grandchild And so essentially an exposure to a mom can have this transgenerational effect because of the exposures that occur in the womb
    - Miller Lets draw that one out a little bit more so thats the bisphenol A
    - Woodruff bisphenol A correct
    - Miller So where would we find that in products that we might encounter daily
    - Woodruff bisphenol A is actually one of those chemicals shown to disrupt the endocrine system theres a recent study thats just online now in Environmental Health Perspectives that everybody carries some kind of burden of bisphenol A in their body And the sources of exposure are thought primarily to be through consumer type products so its in the lining of cans its in certain types of plastic bottles it can leak from certain types of plastic bottles and plastics those are thought to be the primary sources of bisphenol A
    - I would like to point out that as the science continues to develop we are finding that a lot of these chemicals that are of high concern now bisphenol A phthalates appear to be coming from sources that weve either traditionally not looked at or not part of the existing regulatory structures that we have to govern chemicals For example they can show up in cosmetics or shampoos or food can linings and what ends up happening is we dont actually have all the information we really need to figure out what are all the real sources of this chemical because we dont really have the tools from a sort of policy standpoint to identify where theyre coming from
    - Miller Lets make a brief digression Lets say that I want to create a new cosmetic At this point what are the regulatory rules about what I can put into those cosmetics or a shampoo or toothpaste or any other consumer product Does this list of chemicals I use have to be approved by someone or checked
    - Woodruff It depends on whether its a new chemical or an existing chemical So if you manufacture a new chemical it does have to be registered with EPA and they do some kind of check to evaluate whether is has potential for human health harm Whether thats a satisfactory process or not is debated If you use an existing chemical and youre putting it into a cosmetic my understanding is that would go through FDA it would not go through EPA and FDAs current program for evaluating things like cosmetics is really primarily a volunteer program The industrys asked to self regulate themselves in terms of identifying chemicals which may be a potential for harm
    - Miller Thats very reassuring
    - Woodruff laughter
    - Miller How about if I want to make a new kind of plastic bottle for bottled water
    - Woodruff Well again if you make a new chemical there is some process to evaluate that from FDA If you use an existing chemical and you wanna make a new kind of bottle it probably would be covered under consumer products safety commission which again is more of a voluntary less regulatorylike structure
    - In terms of regulation in terms of whos monitoring the types of things that we might be exposed to EPA probably has the strongest set of laws in terms of being able to OK lets go monitor whats in the air lets actually figure out if its a problem for people
    - It doesnt really work like that for consumer products or cosmetics
    - Miller So in talking about the long list of existing chemicals its tens of thousands correct
    - Woodruff Yes tens of thousands
    - Miller And there is this synergistic effect the combined effect we talked about earlier and Im wondering if you could spend a few moments discussing that
    - Woodruff In our life you could get exposed to environmental contaminants through lots of different ways Its in the air we breathe its in the water we drink theres contaminants in food as we discussed some of the consumer products its in shampoos and cosmetics so somebody is not just exposed to one particular contaminant at a time they essentially get exposure to multiple contaminants And we know this has been verified both through the independent analysis looking at these various contaminants and whether people are exposed and then looking at actual people and measuring the level of contaminants in people and you can see that most people carry several different types of chemicals in their body the challenge to all this agencies who are supposed to be regulating environmental contaminants arent looking at well is this particular contaminant gonna be a problem for human health theyre looking typically at studies where they take a bunch of animals and they expose it to one chemical at a time
    - Which doesnt really reflect whats going on in the real world So there have been movements to for some experimenters to look at well what happens if we expose animals to a bunch of different chemicals like not just one or two but seven chemicals and theres a nice set of studies that have come out of some researchers at EPA showing that for example when animals are exposed to multiple phthalates or some phthalates and some pesticides both of which act on the male reproductive system that you can get an effect that is essentially additive That is greater than if you were exposed to just one chemical So more animals will get essentially the health effect theyll have more impact on their testosterone levels theyll have greater incidence of Hypospadias and cryptorchidism like we discussed than they would if they were exposed to a certain chemical
    - Miller So are there scientists other than those at the EPA actually looking at the synergeristic effect
    - Woodruff There are scientists looking at this issue in a number of different institutions but they tend to be focusing on different systems for example there has been some nice work done by some scientists at Ruckers looking at the combined effects of different types of pesticides that act on the brain during development and the effects on the neurodevelopmental system there has been some other studies looking at the effects on exposure to chemicals which can disrupt the thyroid system and how those multiple exposures can combine to essentially additively effect the impacts on reductions on certain thyroid hormone levels
    - Miller Is the hope for this program here at UCSF to we talked about bridging earlier pulling all this information together and doing something with it is that an objective
    - Woodruff Yes we have three primary objectives One is to increase the science base through research The second is education both education within the trainees professionals and students and also education of existing health professionals and patients and the third is policy and policy really has multiple pieces but roughly we have to pull together the science synthesize it and then translate it to the audience who is trying to make decisions
    - And so in terms of your question one of the things Im very interested in is pulling these pieces of information together and looking at what they can tell us in terms of well what are the kinds of actions we should be taking in the policy arena that can better protect the public from impacts from environmental contaminants and are the current policy tools that we have really meeting the challenges that are facing us in terms of what the science is saying
    - Miller Will there be diagnostic tools lets say for clinicians that arise from this
    - Woodruff Its possible one of the things thats very interesting actually is trying to also bridge the gap between people who are doing animal experiments and people who are looking at human experiments So for example I talked to you about this issue about exposures to phthalates and the issue about anogenital distance which I mentioned has been a traditional measure of male reproductive organ development well thats actually never been looked at in humans And a researcher at University of Rochester Shauna Swan actually published a study about two years ago looking at exposures in pregnant moms and what was the anogenital distance in their offspring And she found that the higher the exposures to phthalates the shorter the anogenital distance in the offspring Now part of this research project is to actually develop more of a standardized tool of how to measure this in the clinic and shes actually working with Larry Baskin in terms of thinking about well how do we standardize this tool whats the best way to measure it and then can we actually introduce this into clinical care in terms of diagnostic measurements
    - Miller So now we have all this information and Im thinking of friends of mine who happen to be pregnant at the moment and theyre gonna listen to this broadcast and they might be panicked so what can an average person do whether its a woman who is pregnant or not to protect themselves
    - Woodruff I think theres two things to think about in terms of this question the first is what are some of the practical things that I as someone whos pregnant or someone who has kids can do to minimize my exposures to some of these contaminants There are some relatively simple things people can do for example dont microwave in plastic and throw out old plastic containers because they tend to leak more than your newer plastics
    - Another thing is to try and buy locally produced organic food when its reasonable certain types of food are better to buy than others and another issue is well you can also buy as youve probably seen an explosion on this in the market you can buy consumer products shampoos hairs and lotions that are either EU compliant the EU does not allow certain chemicals in their products or
    - Miller EU being the European Union
    - Woodruff European Union unlike the United States or more organic in nature
    - Miller Well Im still worried but Im happy youre on the case
    - Woodruff OH I wanted to say another thing actually Its great that people can take personal actions to try and reduce their exposures and some of those can work very well but to me the way that we can best protect the public is also to ask the government to do a better job in terms of what theyre doing to try and eliminate or reduce those exposures that are harmful
    - Miller And how would we do that
    - Woodruff You have to call your legislature I think the key is that if there is pressure from concerned citizens on their legislature that they will then respond by insuring either that the government agencies are adequately doing their job or pass new laws that sort of eliminate the kinds of things that are potential exposures to kids
    - So for example that phthalates in toys bill I talked to you about That was partly because there were some concerned parents well first actually it goes back to yknow the bill in San Francisco to get rid of phthalates in toys in San Francisco That was pushed by a group of parents who were concerned about having these products in their toys and then that ended up being pushed at a state level and now were gonna have a ban in California
    - Miller So your role is to bring this information forward and perhaps that would be the spur that others would use to put pressure on legislators and other government agencies
    - Woodruff Yes wed like to be able to provide a conduit for information that could provide good decisionmaking that could result in better public health protection
    - Miller Tracey thank you for joining us Im still worried but I feel better youre on the case thanks
    - Woodruff Good I hope I didnt paralyse you thats the bad thing Youre welcome

    title: "Health in the Time of Poison: A Conversation with Reproductive Health Expert Tracey Woodruff, PhD"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Tracey Woodruff
    - Anyone familiar with clinical trials understands the extraordinary lengths taken in testing new drugs to determine that they are both safe and effective
    - We also know by cruel example that these safeguards sometimes fail
    - When they do there is always a great hue and cry and a lot of finger pointing about who is most to blame for these unwanted risks to human health
    - Why then I ask is there not similar outrage about the chemicals released into our environment many of them in the last years which pose a clear threat to human health and which continue to amass and multiply in staggering amounts without proper testing or oversight
    - From the increase in male genital abnormalities at birth to the early onset of puberty in girls and from the declining levels of testosterone to the rising rates of breast cancer chemicals like bisphenol A phthalates PCBs and PBDEs are leaving their nasty mark on humanity Indeed there is increasing evidence that the effects of certain chemicals are being passed on to our grandchildren
    - How is that for a genetic legacy to make our ancestors proud
    - Tracey Woodruff PhD director of UCSFs Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment part of UCSFs National Center of Excellence in Womens Health understands these threats all too well Woodruff who worked in the Office of Policy Economics and Innovation at the federal Environmental Protection Agency before coming to UCSF is an expert on the impact of chemicals on reproductive health in both men and women She has a particular interest in the effects of air pollution on children
    - But it is the wider public interest on which she has now set her sights The truth is that pertinent information information that might energize the public and policymakers alike lives isolated in the worlds of basic science environmental science and health policy Woodruffs role is to ferret out combine educate translate and bring the science into the public eye and into the clinic where it can do the most good
    - They say the truth will set you free In this case it might save us all

    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Im here today with Tracey Woodruff director of the program on reproductive health and the environment and an associate professor in residence at the department of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at UCSF Welcome Tracy
    - Woodruff Thank you Jeff
    - Miller Now reproductive sciences that has a certain Orwellian ring to it can you explain what that is or what they are
    - Woodruff Well what were interested in in terms of reproductive sciences is really all those pieces that go along with our ability to reproduce Essentially our ability to get pregnant ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and have a healthy childhood and then those parts that go along with having the ability again to reproduce later So all those things like being able to have a healthy reproductive system So ability to get pregnant ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and then look at issues related to those pieces that are related to reproductive function later
    - When you go through puberty there are certain parts of the body that change Women develop breasts they develop the ability to menstruate their ovaries start to function normally so that they can reproduce later in life Reproductive issues can occur in any of those parts of the body later on in life for women Similarly with men their ability to reproduce in terms of normally functioning penis and testicles and their ability to have normal sperm counts and later reproduce
    - Miller Is this a field that is common at other research universities or is it something particular to UCSF
    - Woodruff In terms of reproductive sciences any department of obstetrics and gynecology would be concerned about all these particular issues that cover reproductive health in terms of ability to conceive ability to carry a healthy pregnancy and then subsequent functioning of the different reproductive systems in men and women Whats unique about the program at UCSF is our focus on how environmental contaminants can interfere with each of those different stages during the life course and affect the ability of people to either have a healthy child or have problems in their reproductive system later in life
    - Miller So was there a moment in your career maybe even in your childhood when you first became interested in science
    - Woodruff I actually come from a background in engineering and that was somewhat inherited from my own father who was trained in engineering and Ive always been interested in math and science as a child I actually have a undergraduate degree in electrical engineering but when I was an undergraduate I wanted to do something that was a little broader and I was very captured with issues relating to the environment
    - I actually went to get my PhD at a joint program between UCSF and UC Berkeley in bioengineering which at the time was quite small and now is actually a whole department at each of the universities And then I sort of moved into the field of human health I went from engineering and then became interested in this idea about well how can I work in a field that really is both looking at the impacts on human health and help improve human health I became very interested in how the environment may be playing a role in impacting human health And thats a little bit of my trajectory
    - Miller So did you build bridges with toys as a young girl
    - Woodruff Im trying to remember I was a tomboy yeah I was very interested in building things I built a lot of models of ships and cars and things
    - Miller Did you ever feel discriminated against as a young girl growing up for liking math and science sometimes we hear that that is still the case today
    - Woodruff No I didnt feel like people gave me a hard time because I liked math and science I do remember my mother buying me a chemistry set when I was probably about ten that said growing boys toy and we thought it was kind of funny at that time but when I look back on it that was obviously not appropriate
    - When I grew up it was also the emergence of the feminist movement during the Seventies and so I think there was a lot of recognition about the potential of women and encouraging them to go into different types of fields like math and science so you know its interesting to sort of think back now looking at todays young women and whether theyre still being equally encouraged but certainly gender issues in toys still remained
    - Miller Were there a lot of women working at the EPA I know thats where you were before you came to UCSF so could you tell me what you were doing at that famed institution
    - Woodruff I spent years at the US Environmental Protection Agency I was there for both the Clinton and Bush administrations and while I was at EPA I had a very unique and interesting job
    - I worked in whats loosely called the office of policy And the office of policy is a part of EPA that essentially both intersects with looking at how EPA does their regulations and also provides advice on different kinds of aspects related to policy development at the US national level And my job was a little bit unique because I was able to both participate in original studies I did a lot of work on issues related to air pollution And develop information to access the levels of air pollution outside and then look at the impacts of air pollution particularly on perinatal health
    - I also got very interested in issues related to child development During that time during the early part of the Clinton years and following into the Bush years there was a growing recognition push on at the agency to really focus on these issues about how environmental contaminants can affect early development A lot of science shows that when the developing organism is exposed to environmental contaminants that exposure can represent a greater time of susceptibility compared to exposures as an adult
    - So the science in this area is much more robust but at the time back in the s it wasnt very well integrated into the thinking of EPA about how do we both advance the science in terms of exposures during life and revealing what those susceptibilities might be and then what does that mean in terms of the kind of policies and regulations we do in terms of trying to make sure we protect the whole public
    - So some of the areas that I also was able to work on that sort of intersected in that was looking at how policies that EPA sets in terms of national guidelines on how they think about environmental contaminants I participated in a lot of those in terms of both writing guidelines advising the upper management at EPA about things that they should do in order to develop policies that protect children better and also develop tools analytic tools that policy makers could use to try and monitor trends in environmental factors that may be important for kids environmental health
    - Miller I have to ask this question were you ever concerned about the liability issues as you were uncovering more information about what industries or what chemicals might be doing what to whom and when
    - Woodruff Well you mean in terms of me personally being sued
    - Miller No but in terms of the kinds of industries that might be implicated as the source of some these chemicals
    - Woodruff When you work at the US Environmental Protection Agency you are very familiar with all the industries who are concerned about the implications about what EPA is doing for their work Because its a community that is obviously impacted by the types of decisions EPA makes So they make a point of coming to visit or sending their concerns to EPA So yes we interacted with them often on different types of issues
    - Miller Now you have moved from a government institution to an academic institution Why UCSF
    - Woodruff UCSF represents a very unique and interesting opportunity in terms of looking at issues related to environmental health UCSF is obviously a premier medical school a medical institution that offers professional health training in medicine dentistry and nursing
    - Miller And pharmacy
    - Woodruff And pharmacy And pharmacys actually very important because they have a whole program that deals with looking at toxicology But the thing thats very interesting about UCSF in terms of both having a very premier professional school and also very high calibre research in the basic sciences is that theres really very little going on in terms of the intersection between the issues that theyre concerned about which primarily relate to human health and environmental contaminants So the broader theme is that a lot of people work in the health sciences and theyre a group of people who do work in environmental health sciences but theres not very good intersection between the two even though each field could benefit greatly from looking at what each other is doing
    - For example some of the things we know from pharmaceutical drugs and how they affect young children is very pertinent to what EPA or other agencies or policy people are thinking about in terms of looking at the impacts of environmental contaminants on development So coming to UCSF represents a really unique opportunity to engage with basic scientists and clinicians and other healthcare providers who have a different set of pieces of information about human health and development that can be very informative to thinking about how can environmental contaminants play in terms of impacting human health and development
    - Miller So I see a bridge here your engineering background bridging a gap
    - Woodruff laughter
    - Miller If youll indulge me for a second about twenty years ago I was in a car ride with one of UCSFs experts on occupational health and we were doing a story on human health impacts of a toxic waste dump He told me then that humans were part of this unwitting experiment on themselves that there were tens of thousands of chemicals being released into the environment and we had no idea of what the potential environmental impacts were
    - Now flash forward twenty years later Im sitting here across from you I read about reports on these Artic villages where twice as many girls as boys are being born because of environmental contaminants I was alarmed twenty years ago should I be panicked now What exactly is going on what is the scope of this story
    - Woodruff Well first of all you shouldnt panic I mean obviously there is an issue for concern One of the things thats very interesting in working in this field particularly when I talk to other people about my job Im like oh Im really interested in environmental contaminants and how they impact either prenatal health or child health and then you start to talk about it just like you had this experience in the car you talk to parents and they say well there werent kids with peanut allergies when I was a kid and now lots of kids have severe peanut allergies
    - Kids didnt really have asthma and now asthma is much more prevalent than is used to be more kids appear to have neurodevelopmental disabilities increases in autism or attention deficit disorder Then you marry that with what we know from data that being collected nationally from the CDC that shows that everybody carries with them a load of environmental contaminants Whether its lead or mercury new studies have come out about bistinalay and phthalates when you talk about these things then people say oh youre job is a little bit depressing and how do you not just wanna go and put yourself in a bubble and hide I think the thing thats important to remember is yes we have challenges ahead of us we need to keep working on but we also have examples of success in the past where weve actually been able to reduce the impact of environmental contaminants primarily through actions that happen at a broad level
    - For example when I was growing up there was lead in gasoline There is no more lead in gasoline in the United States And thats because EPA took the lead out of gasoline in the s
    - Miller The lead thats showing up in our body burden counts wheres that coming from
    - Woodruff Well some of the lead thats showing up is theres sort of trace amounts left theres still some places for example that lead smelters in the US that are still in operation theres a concern now with lead in some consumer products that sort of popped up because the whole globalization of trade You heard about the lead in the toys so we both can successfully get rid of things but we also have to keep vigilant about keeping things out of contact to the human health
    - So lead was a very great example Body burdens of lead that we thought were unachievable back in the seventies we now have levels that are extraordinarily low compared to what they were in the seventies And recently youll see for example in the state of California the governor signed a bill to remove phthalates from toys Well when those phthalates are removed from toys Im sure youll see that the levels of phthalates in children will drop and as we start to march towards and look at other sources of some of these contaminants that are ubiquitous and we look at interventions that can actually remove them from exposures to the public we can be successful in terms of reducing that burden from environmental contaminants
    - Miller You mentioned earlier when we were talking about the development of human organism and I guess theres a particular class of chemicals the endocrinedisrupting chemicals
    - Woodruff Yes
    - Miller that have a particular impact so could you describe what they can do and at certain critical stages
    - Woodruff So there is a concern and this has been emerging over Id say roughly the last twenty years through both scientific experimentation and communication of the science to the public about chemicals which have the ability to mimic naturally occurring hormones in the body So chemicals that can act like estrogen or chemicals that can act like testosterone or chemicals that can interfere with the production of estrogen or testosterone And if those chemicals do that in the body the hormones which are part of change at certain levels during development and are part of the natural development of the reproductive organs If you interfere with those then they can have long downstream consequences in terms of health effects
    - So for example when a male boy is developing in utero their levels of testosterone can change dramatically they go from very low to almost adult levels and then back down again because testosterone is a very important part of the development of the penis and the descendance of the testicles So that when the baby boy is born he has a normal set of reproductive organs
    - Now animal experiments have shown that if you expose a animals to phthalates which basically reduce levels of testosterone you can actually inhibit the normal development both of the penis and the testicles resulting in what we call Hypospadias which is incomplete formation of the penis cryptorganism which is undescended testicles or you can have even more subtle markers of incomplete male development for example there is a measure of the distance from the anus to the genitals called anogenital distance which is a fairly standard measure that toxicologists use to measure complete development of the reproductive organs in the male
    - Exposure to phthalates can also reduce that distance thereby an indicator that the male reproductive organs have not completely developed
    - Miller Is there any indication that the rates of these problems are rising
    - Woodruff Yes the data suggests that there has been increases in Hypospadias and Cryptorchidism there is data in certain areas showing that sort of downstream events which are reduction in sperm viability whether its damaged sperm low sperm count etc which can lead to infertility there have been studies suggesting that theres been decreases in sperm in certain populations And there was a very interesting study that came out recently showing that testosterone levels have declined It was from a cohort study in Massachusetts basically showing that men measured at the same age their testosterone levels from ten or years ago compared to today have lower testosterone same age then they did about sooddyearsago
    - And we also know that theres been an increase in rates of testicular cancer And thats gone up about in white men over the last years which is also related to this issue about effects in utero from exposure to has been shown to be related through animal studies from exposure to environmental contaminants
    - Miller OK weve talked about males how about females What would be some of the impacts
    - Woodruff Well I have to say the area of female reproductive health is not as well studied
    - Miller A gender bias
    - Woodruff Laughter A gender bias a new agenda Though theres been a lot of studies about breast cancer which is considered in the family of reproductive health problems for women What some studies have shown is that exposure to some of these endocrine destructing chemicals before birth can predispose the mammary cells to be more likely to generate into a breast cancer
    - We do know from animal studies that also exposures during puberty are very important You mentioned the windows of susceptibility basically the windows of susceptibility are those times primarily during development when there are great changes occurring in the body And those times of great change can also present opportunities of increased risk from exposure to environmental contaminants
    - So during puberty as we talked about earlier there are certain changes going on in particular areas of the body Young girls are developing breasts during puberty Well that also represents a time of increased susceptibility to environmental contaminants So there are for example animal studies showing that exposure to chemicals which can damage DNA can cause a higher rate of breast cancer in animals that are exposed during puberty than even if theyre exposed when they are younger or older
    - Miller And is the onset of puberty coming at an earlier age for women
    - Woodruff Yes the issue about the onset of puberty is something that is of growing concern There have been starting probably about in the mid s studies documenting that the age of onset of particular parts of puberty appear to be going down There are three pieces of puberty theres breast development theres pubic hair and then theres menarche which is the start of the menstrual cycle And the data suggests that the age of thelarche breast development has gone down The age of menarche does not appear to be changing too much
    - Miller So could we put some years on this it was now its or it was now
    - Woodruff Id have to check exactly but there are definitely reports showing that girls as young as six or seven can be beginning to start puberty
    - Miller And that would have been considered at one time extremely rare but now more common
    - Woodruff More common right
    - Miller Something else that I read in your reports also struck me We ve talked about some clearly defined problems in male genitalia at birth or something but that there are these more insidious facts in a way that show up later in adulthood and these things may set you up for lets say increased rates of particular kinds of cancer
    - Woodruff Right
    - Woodruff Yeah Its interesting because some of these studies go all the way back to some of their initial concerns about this were raised during the DES episode So DES is Diethyl it was a drug that was given to women back in the s s with the idea that it would prevent miscarriages which it did not Subsequently the daughters of the mothers who were taking this drug developed a very rare form of vaginal cancer Even though the moms themselves suffered no adverse consequences Basically providing the very tragic but key information that exposures in the womb could manifest themselves in outcomes that dont occur until the offspring are much older Essentially the daughters were older in their s or older when they got these rare forms of vaginal cancers and since those studies have come up a lot of different other types of reproductive health outcomes have been tied to prenatal exposure to DES
    - And now what were seeing is that it affects their childrens ability to both have another child and then it can also pass on to their children And theres a very nice set of studies done by Pat Hunt up at the Washington State in Pullman showing that exposure to bisphenol A in the womb can affect essentially the developing eggs of that moms daughter that would be her subsequent grandchild And so essentially an exposure to a mom can have this transgenerational effect because of the exposures that occur in the womb
    - Miller Lets draw that one out a little bit more so thats the bisphenol A
    - Woodruff bisphenol A correct
    - Miller So where would we find that in products that we might encounter daily
    - Woodruff bisphenol A is actually one of those chemicals shown to disrupt the endocrine system theres a recent study thats just online now in Environmental Health Perspectives that everybody carries some kind of burden of bisphenol A in their body And the sources of exposure are thought primarily to be through consumer type products so its in the lining of cans its in certain types of plastic bottles it can leak from certain types of plastic bottles and plastics those are thought to be the primary sources of bisphenol A
    - I would like to point out that as the science continues to develop we are finding that a lot of these chemicals that are of high concern now bisphenol A phthalates appear to be coming from sources that weve either traditionally not looked at or not part of the existing regulatory structures that we have to govern chemicals For example they can show up in cosmetics or shampoos or food can linings and what ends up happening is we dont actually have all the information we really need to figure out what are all the real sources of this chemical because we dont really have the tools from a sort of policy standpoint to identify where theyre coming from
    - Miller Lets make a brief digression Lets say that I want to create a new cosmetic At this point what are the regulatory rules about what I can put into those cosmetics or a shampoo or toothpaste or any other consumer product Does this list of chemicals I use have to be approved by someone or checked
    - Woodruff It depends on whether its a new chemical or an existing chemical So if you manufacture a new chemical it does have to be registered with EPA and they do some kind of check to evaluate whether is has potential for human health harm Whether thats a satisfactory process or not is debated If you use an existing chemical and youre putting it into a cosmetic my understanding is that would go through FDA it would not go through EPA and FDAs current program for evaluating things like cosmetics is really primarily a volunteer program The industrys asked to self regulate themselves in terms of identifying chemicals which may be a potential for harm
    - Miller Thats very reassuring
    - Woodruff laughter
    - Miller How about if I want to make a new kind of plastic bottle for bottled water
    - Woodruff Well again if you make a new chemical there is some process to evaluate that from FDA If you use an existing chemical and you wanna make a new kind of bottle it probably would be covered under consumer products safety commission which again is more of a voluntary less regulatorylike structure
    - In terms of regulation in terms of whos monitoring the types of things that we might be exposed to EPA probably has the strongest set of laws in terms of being able to OK lets go monitor whats in the air lets actually figure out if its a problem for people
    - It doesnt really work like that for consumer products or cosmetics
    - Miller So in talking about the long list of existing chemicals its tens of thousands correct
    - Woodruff Yes tens of thousands
    - Miller And there is this synergistic effect the combined effect we talked about earlier and Im wondering if you could spend a few moments discussing that
    - Woodruff In our life you could get exposed to environmental contaminants through lots of different ways Its in the air we breathe its in the water we drink theres contaminants in food as we discussed some of the consumer products its in shampoos and cosmetics so somebody is not just exposed to one particular contaminant at a time they essentially get exposure to multiple contaminants And we know this has been verified both through the independent analysis looking at these various contaminants and whether people are exposed and then looking at actual people and measuring the level of contaminants in people and you can see that most people carry several different types of chemicals in their body the challenge to all this agencies who are supposed to be regulating environmental contaminants arent looking at well is this particular contaminant gonna be a problem for human health theyre looking typically at studies where they take a bunch of animals and they expose it to one chemical at a time
    - Which doesnt really reflect whats going on in the real world So there have been movements to for some experimenters to look at well what happens if we expose animals to a bunch of different chemicals like not just one or two but seven chemicals and theres a nice set of studies that have come out of some researchers at EPA showing that for example when animals are exposed to multiple phthalates or some phthalates and some pesticides both of which act on the male reproductive system that you can get an effect that is essentially additive That is greater than if you were exposed to just one chemical So more animals will get essentially the health effect theyll have more impact on their testosterone levels theyll have greater incidence of Hypospadias and cryptorchidism like we discussed than they would if they were exposed to a certain chemical
    - Miller So are there scientists other than those at the EPA actually looking at the synergeristic effect
    - Woodruff There are scientists looking at this issue in a number of different institutions but they tend to be focusing on different systems for example there has been some nice work done by some scientists at Ruckers looking at the combined effects of different types of pesticides that act on the brain during development and the effects on the neurodevelopmental system there has been some other studies looking at the effects on exposure to chemicals which can disrupt the thyroid system and how those multiple exposures can combine to essentially additively effect the impacts on reductions on certain thyroid hormone levels
    - Miller Is the hope for this program here at UCSF to we talked about bridging earlier pulling all this information together and doing something with it is that an objective
    - Woodruff Yes we have three primary objectives One is to increase the science base through research The second is education both education within the trainees professionals and students and also education of existing health professionals and patients and the third is policy and policy really has multiple pieces but roughly we have to pull together the science synthesize it and then translate it to the audience who is trying to make decisions
    - And so in terms of your question one of the things Im very interested in is pulling these pieces of information together and looking at what they can tell us in terms of well what are the kinds of actions we should be taking in the policy arena that can better protect the public from impacts from environmental contaminants and are the current policy tools that we have really meeting the challenges that are facing us in terms of what the science is saying
    - Miller Will there be diagnostic tools lets say for clinicians that arise from this
    - Woodruff Its possible one of the things thats very interesting actually is trying to also bridge the gap between people who are doing animal experiments and people who are looking at human experiments So for example I talked to you about this issue about exposures to phthalates and the issue about anogenital distance which I mentioned has been a traditional measure of male reproductive organ development well thats actually never been looked at in humans And a researcher at University of Rochester Shauna Swan actually published a study about two years ago looking at exposures in pregnant moms and what was the anogenital distance in their offspring And she found that the higher the exposures to phthalates the shorter the anogenital distance in the offspring Now part of this research project is to actually develop more of a standardized tool of how to measure this in the clinic and shes actually working with Larry Baskin in terms of thinking about well how do we standardize this tool whats the best way to measure it and then can we actually introduce this into clinical care in terms of diagnostic measurements
    - Miller So now we have all this information and Im thinking of friends of mine who happen to be pregnant at the moment and theyre gonna listen to this broadcast and they might be panicked so what can an average person do whether its a woman who is pregnant or not to protect themselves
    - Woodruff I think theres two things to think about in terms of this question the first is what are some of the practical things that I as someone whos pregnant or someone who has kids can do to minimize my exposures to some of these contaminants There are some relatively simple things people can do for example dont microwave in plastic and throw out old plastic containers because they tend to leak more than your newer plastics
    - Another thing is to try and buy locally produced organic food when its reasonable certain types of food are better to buy than others and another issue is well you can also buy as youve probably seen an explosion on this in the market you can buy consumer products shampoos hairs and lotions that are either EU compliant the EU does not allow certain chemicals in their products or
    - Miller EU being the European Union
    - Woodruff European Union unlike the United States or more organic in nature
    - Miller Well Im still worried but Im happy youre on the case
    - Woodruff OH I wanted to say another thing actually Its great that people can take personal actions to try and reduce their exposures and some of those can work very well but to me the way that we can best protect the public is also to ask the government to do a better job in terms of what theyre doing to try and eliminate or reduce those exposures that are harmful
    - Miller And how would we do that
    - Woodruff You have to call your legislature I think the key is that if there is pressure from concerned citizens on their legislature that they will then respond by insuring either that the government agencies are adequately doing their job or pass new laws that sort of eliminate the kinds of things that are potential exposures to kids
    - So for example that phthalates in toys bill I talked to you about That was partly because there were some concerned parents well first actually it goes back to yknow the bill in San Francisco to get rid of phthalates in toys in San Francisco That was pushed by a group of parents who were concerned about having these products in their toys and then that ended up being pushed at a state level and now were gonna have a ban in California
    - Miller So your role is to bring this information forward and perhaps that would be the spur that others would use to put pressure on legislators and other government agencies
    - Woodruff Yes wed like to be able to provide a conduit for information that could provide good decisionmaking that could result in better public health protection
    - Miller Tracey thank you for joining us Im still worried but I feel better youre on the case thanks
    - Woodruff Good I hope I didnt paralyse you thats the bad thing Youre welcome

    title: "A Bug in Our Blood: A Conversation with UCSF Health Economist Leslie Wilson"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Leslie Wilson
    - Every two seconds someone in America needs a blood transfusion
    - Its not something we think about much unless we happen to manage a blood center or organize a blood drive
    - But this river of whole blood red blood cells platelets and plasma is what keeps millions of us alive when surgery trauma or disease threatens our existence
    - No wonder then that keeping this supply free of infection is so important to public health
    - Of course safety costs money And as UCSF health economist Leslie Wilson PhD has learned when it comes to finding unexpected bloodborne infections like Chagas disease with new tests spending million to save an estimated lives is more than worth it
    - But even now with evidence mounting that a surprisingly large number of American blood donors are carrying the socalled kissing bug disease the screening test is not mandatory
    - Why that is and what health economists can do to speed change have made Wilson an expert in both dollars and common sense

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Im here today with Leslie Wilson a professor of health economics and policy at the School of Pharmacy Welcome Leslie
    - Leslie Wilson Thank you very much
    - Miller Leslie specializes in health services research and economic analysis of disease and the treatments for disease which I guess is a nice definition for health economist but how does one become such a person and maybe you could tell us why
    - Wilson OK Well I started out in the health care field in practice and then found that a lot of decisions about what health care was given to patients depended on how much that treatment cost Some of the newer treatments seemed like they cost a lot of money in the beginning when you had to pay for them but sometimes they saved costs downstream
    - Miller Is that always obvious
    - Wilson No its not obvious so a health economist will look at that and theyll go weigh the value of the treatment from the perspective of both the cost and the benefits of the treatment
    - Miller How do you actually get that kind of information
    - Wilson You can do studies to look at it you can measure all the effects of a particular treatment and all of the costs that go into providing the treatment as well as the savings that are provided from shorter hospital stays or going back to work earlier or things like that
    - Miller So how long have you been a health economist
    - Wilson For a long time years or so
    - Miller How has the field changed Were you alone at the beginning
    - Wilson There were fewer at the beginning Now its pretty common to have health economists in drug industries and managed care systems and also in universities as well working on health care
    - Miller And so this corresponds with the rise in health costs everyone has an interest in finding out what is causing them
    - Wilson Exactly yes
    - Miller There are a lot of studies funded both by pharmaceutical industries as well as other professions and industries
    - Wilson Yes though NIH will fund some purely economic studies but they could fund more I think They sometimes expect it to be attached on to other studies which is sometimes appropriate but we could speed this along more if we had more funding
    - Miller So give me an example of the kinds of things youve studied Ive looked at your resume and Ive seen some publications on everything from teaching of cultural competence to the cost of different prostate cancer treatments Lets talk about the wide range of things youve studied over the years
    - Wilson Mostly Ive studied in three sort of big areas one area is to look at the costeffectiveness of new technologies and so this relates to new products or drugs or testing in different disease and mostly Ive worked in the area of cancer looking at GI cancers also in prostate cancer and other cancers also in rare diseases Ive looked at scleroderma and some chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD which is rare in some instances
    - Miller So when you say technology youre actually talking about everything from a surgical technique to a drug therapy to what
    - Wilson Yes all of those things like for example one study looked at the use of neuromonitoring during ear surgery to see if that reduced the risk of facial paralysis with surgery
    - Miller What did you find in that case
    - Wilson It did It was very costeffective to monitor everybody during ear infection surgery to reduce the risk in just the few who do get those paralyses
    - Miller Have you ever done a study where the cost I know you deal about cost benefit ratios where it just seemed so ethical even if it did cost more it was something that absolutely needed to be done to protect the patient that might not have been done
    - Wilson Yes You look at both the ratio of costtobenefits but you also look at the magnitude of the benefit as well because there are some cases where the benefit is so big that you would want to do it regardless of the costbenefit ratios HIV Treatment at the very beginning is an example of that And a lot of political pressure allowed some of those early treatments that werent very cost effective to go forward
    - Miller Lets talk about cultural competence for example can you tell me something about that study
    - Wilson We were asked by the state to look at the amount of cultural competence that was being taught in California medical schools dental schools and also pharmacy schools And this was in relation to the need to approach the care of mostlyHispanic patients in a cultural competent way And they were looking at all types of proposals of policy to deal with this So I looked really at just what level of teaching occurred in our medical schools and our pharmacy schools to see if those graduates would be prepared to deal with and treat Hispanic patients
    - Miller So youd be looking at the cost of training them vs the
    - Wilson I didnt look at cost in this case I just looked at the health outcome
    - Miller I see
    - Wilson So sometimes Ill look at one side or the other instead of both together and the next step would have been to look at the cost of different kinds of proposals
    - Miller So its not always about dollars
    - Wilson No its not always about dollars
    - Miller What did you find in the case of cultural competence out of curiosity
    - Wilson I looked at both private and statefunded schools and it looked like statefunded professional schools had more cultural competence and a lot of it depended on how many culturally varied faculty were in the programs as well
    - We also found that the students had many courses in this area if you included their practice sites Many schools had practice sites that included underserved areas and a lot of those were run by the students themselves So they seemed very sensitive to that
    - Miller Lets move on to prostate cancer treatment Obviously this is a very important topic today
    - Wilson Yes it is and there are a number of different treatments for prostate cancer ranging from just active surveillance or watchful waiting to surgical radiation also some hormonal treatments as well
    - And a lot of these are based on what kind of patient you are what age you are how soon your tumor was found all of those kinds of things and so your treatment would depend on that And what we did this time was just look at the cost piece of this and we compared costs of all these different kinds of treatments
    - Essentially what we found is that the treatment costs did vary but they varied more on the severity of the patient than they did on the difference of the treatment So we concluded that some previous studies that showed that you shouldnt do some treatments because they were too costly were really only costly because they were treating the sickest patients therefore people should still select treatments based not on cost but on what was most appropriate for their treatment given their condition
    - Miller And when say people youre talking about established medical care providers
    - Wilson Yes And theyre doing that now but we didnt want to have changes in that approach based on studies that erroneously really just looked at just shortterm costs and didnt account for some of the age and severity factors that we were able to do
    - Miller How is the information gathered actually used There is no requirement that when you find x that x is actually implemented in the marketplace correct
    - Wilson No and thats partly the responsibility of the researcher to try to disseminate this research through publications but also through talking to other people The cultural competence research was written up of course but also I gave a presentation to the committee that was reviewing those kinds of treatments
    - I also did a study for workers compensation and they actually used the results of that study in writing some of their regulations and we were able to help them with that So many times theres a very direct response and sometimes less use of it of course
    - Miller Speaking of presentations I know that you made one about the safety of Californias blood supply as it relates to Chagas disease which for some of you who dont know what Chagas disease is its a parasitic disease correct
    - Wilson Right
    - Miller Mostly found in Latin America transmitted by an insect bite
    - Wilson Yes This is a disease which is in about to million people in Latin America including Mexico This is Central South America and Mexico and its usually contracted if you live there when youre young and by a bite a beetle or just kind of a bug that looks like a beetle It bites you and then it actually defecates in the wound that it has made in you and it itches and you scratch it into the wound
    - Miller And they have a particular affinity for the face I understand sometimes called kissing bugs
    - Wilson Yes and theres a characteristic swelling of the eye that is seen but the bug can actually bite you anywhere Only about five percent of the people get sick with flulike symptoms when they first get the bite and a lot of times its not identified as a Chagas bite and so they dont get treatment at that time
    - Miller I want to stop you right there what would the treatment be
    - Wilson There are two drugs Besmidasol and nefurtimox and those treatments are sort of difficult treatments because they have side effects but theyre pretty effective if you give it right away when they get the infection
    - Miller Are they expensive
    - Wilson Theyre not too expensive but theyre barely available One company has stopped making the drug and its only available from the CDC And the other company that makes it wants to stop making it but its just making it you know for awhile So
    - Miller Is it being distributed in the areas where its actually occurring
    - Wilson Yes but it can be hard to even get in those places in the future so people are concerned about that as well
    - Miller So even if you were diagnosed there might not be a drug available to treat you
    - Wilson Well there is right now but I hope there is some awareness that we need to continue to have these drugs available So I think thatll happen in light of the new studies that have gone on in the blood supply
    - Miller Lets just say the person is infected What happens because theres an acute phase and then a chronic phase this doesnt go away
    - Wilson Right There is an acute phase which is what I just talked about the flulike symptoms but mostly those arent identified then people go into sort of a latent phase where they have no signs or symptoms theyre aware of of the disease and then about percent of the people in to years develop severe chronic symptoms of the disease
    - Miller And that would include
    - Wilson And that includes mainly symptoms of heart disease congestive heart disease and conduction difficulties of the heart where often the first symptoms are sudden death from cardiac causes where your conduction system stops working Or you gradually get an enlarged heart and congestive heart failure Also there are swellings in your gut where your whole digestive tract loses its innervation and therefore there is severe constipation and bloating so serious that you have to have surgery and people can die of that symptom as well
    - Miller So what does this have to do with the blood supply in California
    - Wilson Well in Central and South America its mandatory to test the blood for Chagas disease because Chagas disease can be transmitted through the blood system as well and so the prevalence of Chagas in those countries is fairly high so its important that this not also be transmitted in the blood In Mexico its voluntary to test so they test a lot but not everything and in the United States there was no testing until just recently In December of last year a test was approved for the first time to be able to screen for Chagas in the blood supply and they began to test in about percent of the blood starting January first of this year So now our blood system is being tested
    - Miller So you were asked to determine the prevalence of Chagas within the blood supply
    - Wilson I started the study before this testing to try to identify what the risk might be of Chagas in the blood system to encourage testing actually We started the test a yearandahalf before the drug was approved and we surveyed patients in five blood systems in California and asked them about risk factors that they had in terms of where they lived and what kind of housing they were in because these bugs like to hide in thatched roofs or cracks in the wall and things like that and whether theyd received blood in those areas where they could have risk of contracting it that way or if they had a risk from birth from a mother who had Chagas because thats another way of transmitting
    - So we surveyed these people and identified what the risk would be based on where they lived essentially And then we also asked them a lot of other information about general health to identify if they had Chagas disease currently
    - And finally we looked at the costeffectiveness of different screening methods for implementing a blood testing system should this test which now has come to pass begin So we looked at those areas
    - Miller And what did you find
    - Wilson Well at the beginning when we just looked at the risk we looked at three kinds of blood system areas representing three types of locations One was in San Francisco which was sort of a mixed city and also in San Diego which is close to the border and so you would think would have a high risk of Hispanics or Latin Americans coming across the border and then we looked at a more agricultural area in Modesto and areas around there
    - And what we found was that the risk varied of course across these three sites but not necessarily how you would expect it to vary from the prevalence of Hispanics self identified in the community And so we found that San Diego was relatively high risk according to the survey questions but that the agricultural area was not very high and San Francisco was surprisingly high
    - Miller Why do you think that happened
    - Wilson The reason was primarily because everybody in the population is donating blood so some of the people in the agricultural areas were newer immigrants and were not yet donating blood whereas the longer someone has been here we think the more likely they are to donate blood and so therefore more established Hispanic communities are probably donating more So one thing is you cant assume from the population that thats also the population that is donating blood the other thing is there are many people from Latin America who consider themselves more of European descent and dont self identify as Hispanic and that may be the case in San Francisco area because most of the risk was from Latin America
    - And if youre from Latin America you probably have a higher risk of getting Chagas because its more prevalent there than if youre from Mexico So even thought there were fewer numbers of people with risk potential in SF they had a higher prevalence level of risk being from Latin America
    - Miller When you looked at all this data where you able to determine either a presumed degree of risk or an actual level of infection in the blood supply
    - Wilson Well we were only able with these survey instruments to get a level of presumed risk and then this level was compared with the levels that are being obtained now that testing has begun in January
    - Miller And are the two in correspondence or are the results of the real test not available yet
    - Wilson The very first test for the drug approval looked fairly low and much lower than what we had estimated When we looked just at people who lived or were born there then our risk level from these surveys was similar to the risk level in those early studies
    - But now it seems as theyre testing more people that the risk level has gone up and its something like one in seven thousand in Los Angeles and one in sort of in a state area around the US and thats something like Chagas positive people that have been found in the blood supply across the US from January to October
    - Miller So should we be reassured that these tests are keeping our blood supply safe and then theres costs associated with this obviously so if its determined that to prevent this from becoming lodged in the larger population do the people managing the blood distribution think the test was worth the cost
    - Wilson I think that theyre somewhat surprised that theyre getting high numbers in some cases even though with the increase in immigration people were beginning to get more and more concerned as the years went by But I think its very good that we are testing now and it should be remembered that what were looking at is donors who are positive and theyre donating blood that has the potential to pass on Chagas disease but not all of that blood will actually transmit the disease
    - Miller I want to clarify that right now so lets just assume that youre unlucky and you happen to get some blood from an infected donor is it automatically true that youre going to get the disease
    - Wilson No it isnt and we dont really know what the risk of transmission is it may be as low as percent I know in Latin America its as high as percent so were not certain whether its the same in those countries or a little bit different a little bit less maybe because the health of the people is better or something like that
    - So we dont know but we dont really want to transmit that in the blood system anyway
    - Miller Are there any other features of the study that we should know about that you found particularly interesting
    - Wilson I think whats important now is first of all not all blood centers are testing and individual blood centers are trying to decide whether to test and thats where our cost effectiveness study I think was important and also our result that you cant tell from the population around you what your real risk is so people that may think they have very low Hispanic rates according to that population study may in fact have some more risk than they know about So I dont think you should decide on that basis
    - In addition we found that when we looked at a very broad risk through a screening question which is just have you ever lived or traveled to South America or Mexico and were you born to a mother who has we found that about percent of the people say yes to that question So blood centers need to decide whether theyre going to test or not and how many people theyre going to test
    - So we suggest that the maximum you would have to test might be percent of your blood supply if you ask a screening question and this could reduce the cost of testing everyone What we did was we looked at the cost effectiveness of three kinds of testing approaches testing everyone with this new Eliza screening test or only testing those who screened positive compared to testing no one which was the previous policy
    - And we tested this with three levels of risk of Chagas disease depending on what kind of risk that you had And in general we found that testing everyone was cost effective compared to testing no one Also screening first with this verbal screening test and then just testing those positives was also cost effective compared to testing no one
    - So regardless its better to test some than no one So all blood centers should at least do that
    - Miller And effectiveness would be determined by lives saved perhaps
    - Wilson Yes we looked at lives saved And that involves what proportion of the people are likely to get Chagas disease and then have to incur the treatments of Chagas disease which can be or years of treatments of serious health effects And then eventually die from Chagas disease or other causes we had in our model too
    - Miller From a consumers point of view then what can be done to protect yourself when you know that you might be in a situation where youre going to receive blood from a transfusion do you insist that the blood come from centers where Chagas has been tested for Can you even determine that
    - Wilson Well many times people can self donate for themselves if its an elective surgery and thats always a good idea or have someone they know in the family to donate blood for them So thats one thing people are already doing when they can but many times you cannot do that and youre in a trauma situation and you just get blood In that situation I dont know if youre in a position to be asking that question
    - But I think its important for the public to be aware of this and maybe when theyre donating blood its important to be clear on what answers you give when youre donating as well and to mention this in blood donation centers as well
    - Miller One last question so who decides whether or not all the centers that are taking blood actually incorporate this test for Chagas disease
    - Wilson Well the FDA looks at this and of course the blood systems too the American Red Cross and the American Blood Systems and those are the two places that are testing all of their centers and thats about percent of the blood supply so theyre already testing
    - But the FDA has not made it mandatory at this point They can make it mandatory but I think that they are looking at the early studies which are showing what the risk is first before they decide whether they should make it mandatory
    - Miller How long will that take do you suppose
    - Wilson Weve just had the AABB meeting which is the American Association of Blood Banks meeting and thats where all the researchers and also the people who work in the blood banks get together and review data so I would imagine that this was the first data that came out and the first discussions of that and so I would imagine that new guidelines would be issued based on that And we have cost effectiveness results now which show that it is cost effective to at least screen verbally first even at those places that think they have no risk and just test those that do So I think that could be an appropriate approach
    - Miller Well lets hope they follow your lead Thank you Leslie for joining me on Science Caf today keep up the good work
    - Wilson Oh thank you very much it was fun

    - Leslie Wilson
    - Every two seconds someone in America needs a blood transfusion
    - Its not something we think about much unless we happen to manage a blood center or organize a blood drive
    - But this river of whole blood red blood cells platelets and plasma is what keeps millions of us alive when surgery trauma or disease threatens our existence
    - No wonder then that keeping this supply free of infection is so important to public health
    - Of course safety costs money And as UCSF health economist Leslie Wilson PhD has learned when it comes to finding unexpected bloodborne infections like Chagas disease with new tests spending million to save an estimated lives is more than worth it
    - But even now with evidence mounting that a surprisingly large number of American blood donors are carrying the socalled kissing bug disease the screening test is not mandatory
    - Why that is and what health economists can do to speed change have made Wilson an expert in both dollars and common sense

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Im here today with Leslie Wilson a professor of health economics and policy at the School of Pharmacy Welcome Leslie
    - Leslie Wilson Thank you very much
    - Miller Leslie specializes in health services research and economic analysis of disease and the treatments for disease which I guess is a nice definition for health economist but how does one become such a person and maybe you could tell us why
    - Wilson OK Well I started out in the health care field in practice and then found that a lot of decisions about what health care was given to patients depended on how much that treatment cost Some of the newer treatments seemed like they cost a lot of money in the beginning when you had to pay for them but sometimes they saved costs downstream
    - Miller Is that always obvious
    - Wilson No its not obvious so a health economist will look at that and theyll go weigh the value of the treatment from the perspective of both the cost and the benefits of the treatment
    - Miller How do you actually get that kind of information
    - Wilson You can do studies to look at it you can measure all the effects of a particular treatment and all of the costs that go into providing the treatment as well as the savings that are provided from shorter hospital stays or going back to work earlier or things like that
    - Miller So how long have you been a health economist
    - Wilson For a long time years or so
    - Miller How has the field changed Were you alone at the beginning
    - Wilson There were fewer at the beginning Now its pretty common to have health economists in drug industries and managed care systems and also in universities as well working on health care
    - Miller And so this corresponds with the rise in health costs everyone has an interest in finding out what is causing them
    - Wilson Exactly yes
    - Miller There are a lot of studies funded both by pharmaceutical industries as well as other professions and industries
    - Wilson Yes though NIH will fund some purely economic studies but they could fund more I think They sometimes expect it to be attached on to other studies which is sometimes appropriate but we could speed this along more if we had more funding
    - Miller So give me an example of the kinds of things youve studied Ive looked at your resume and Ive seen some publications on everything from teaching of cultural competence to the cost of different prostate cancer treatments Lets talk about the wide range of things youve studied over the years
    - Wilson Mostly Ive studied in three sort of big areas one area is to look at the costeffectiveness of new technologies and so this relates to new products or drugs or testing in different disease and mostly Ive worked in the area of cancer looking at GI cancers also in prostate cancer and other cancers also in rare diseases Ive looked at scleroderma and some chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD which is rare in some instances
    - Miller So when you say technology youre actually talking about everything from a surgical technique to a drug therapy to what
    - Wilson Yes all of those things like for example one study looked at the use of neuromonitoring during ear surgery to see if that reduced the risk of facial paralysis with surgery
    - Miller What did you find in that case
    - Wilson It did It was very costeffective to monitor everybody during ear infection surgery to reduce the risk in just the few who do get those paralyses
    - Miller Have you ever done a study where the cost I know you deal about cost benefit ratios where it just seemed so ethical even if it did cost more it was something that absolutely needed to be done to protect the patient that might not have been done
    - Wilson Yes You look at both the ratio of costtobenefits but you also look at the magnitude of the benefit as well because there are some cases where the benefit is so big that you would want to do it regardless of the costbenefit ratios HIV Treatment at the very beginning is an example of that And a lot of political pressure allowed some of those early treatments that werent very cost effective to go forward
    - Miller Lets talk about cultural competence for example can you tell me something about that study
    - Wilson We were asked by the state to look at the amount of cultural competence that was being taught in California medical schools dental schools and also pharmacy schools And this was in relation to the need to approach the care of mostlyHispanic patients in a cultural competent way And they were looking at all types of proposals of policy to deal with this So I looked really at just what level of teaching occurred in our medical schools and our pharmacy schools to see if those graduates would be prepared to deal with and treat Hispanic patients
    - Miller So youd be looking at the cost of training them vs the
    - Wilson I didnt look at cost in this case I just looked at the health outcome
    - Miller I see
    - Wilson So sometimes Ill look at one side or the other instead of both together and the next step would have been to look at the cost of different kinds of proposals
    - Miller So its not always about dollars
    - Wilson No its not always about dollars
    - Miller What did you find in the case of cultural competence out of curiosity
    - Wilson I looked at both private and statefunded schools and it looked like statefunded professional schools had more cultural competence and a lot of it depended on how many culturally varied faculty were in the programs as well
    - We also found that the students had many courses in this area if you included their practice sites Many schools had practice sites that included underserved areas and a lot of those were run by the students themselves So they seemed very sensitive to that
    - Miller Lets move on to prostate cancer treatment Obviously this is a very important topic today
    - Wilson Yes it is and there are a number of different treatments for prostate cancer ranging from just active surveillance or watchful waiting to surgical radiation also some hormonal treatments as well
    - And a lot of these are based on what kind of patient you are what age you are how soon your tumor was found all of those kinds of things and so your treatment would depend on that And what we did this time was just look at the cost piece of this and we compared costs of all these different kinds of treatments
    - Essentially what we found is that the treatment costs did vary but they varied more on the severity of the patient than they did on the difference of the treatment So we concluded that some previous studies that showed that you shouldnt do some treatments because they were too costly were really only costly because they were treating the sickest patients therefore people should still select treatments based not on cost but on what was most appropriate for their treatment given their condition
    - Miller And when say people youre talking about established medical care providers
    - Wilson Yes And theyre doing that now but we didnt want to have changes in that approach based on studies that erroneously really just looked at just shortterm costs and didnt account for some of the age and severity factors that we were able to do
    - Miller How is the information gathered actually used There is no requirement that when you find x that x is actually implemented in the marketplace correct
    - Wilson No and thats partly the responsibility of the researcher to try to disseminate this research through publications but also through talking to other people The cultural competence research was written up of course but also I gave a presentation to the committee that was reviewing those kinds of treatments
    - I also did a study for workers compensation and they actually used the results of that study in writing some of their regulations and we were able to help them with that So many times theres a very direct response and sometimes less use of it of course
    - Miller Speaking of presentations I know that you made one about the safety of Californias blood supply as it relates to Chagas disease which for some of you who dont know what Chagas disease is its a parasitic disease correct
    - Wilson Right
    - Miller Mostly found in Latin America transmitted by an insect bite
    - Wilson Yes This is a disease which is in about to million people in Latin America including Mexico This is Central South America and Mexico and its usually contracted if you live there when youre young and by a bite a beetle or just kind of a bug that looks like a beetle It bites you and then it actually defecates in the wound that it has made in you and it itches and you scratch it into the wound
    - Miller And they have a particular affinity for the face I understand sometimes called kissing bugs
    - Wilson Yes and theres a characteristic swelling of the eye that is seen but the bug can actually bite you anywhere Only about five percent of the people get sick with flulike symptoms when they first get the bite and a lot of times its not identified as a Chagas bite and so they dont get treatment at that time
    - Miller I want to stop you right there what would the treatment be
    - Wilson There are two drugs Besmidasol and nefurtimox and those treatments are sort of difficult treatments because they have side effects but theyre pretty effective if you give it right away when they get the infection
    - Miller Are they expensive
    - Wilson Theyre not too expensive but theyre barely available One company has stopped making the drug and its only available from the CDC And the other company that makes it wants to stop making it but its just making it you know for awhile So
    - Miller Is it being distributed in the areas where its actually occurring
    - Wilson Yes but it can be hard to even get in those places in the future so people are concerned about that as well
    - Miller So even if you were diagnosed there might not be a drug available to treat you
    - Wilson Well there is right now but I hope there is some awareness that we need to continue to have these drugs available So I think thatll happen in light of the new studies that have gone on in the blood supply
    - Miller Lets just say the person is infected What happens because theres an acute phase and then a chronic phase this doesnt go away
    - Wilson Right There is an acute phase which is what I just talked about the flulike symptoms but mostly those arent identified then people go into sort of a latent phase where they have no signs or symptoms theyre aware of of the disease and then about percent of the people in to years develop severe chronic symptoms of the disease
    - Miller And that would include
    - Wilson And that includes mainly symptoms of heart disease congestive heart disease and conduction difficulties of the heart where often the first symptoms are sudden death from cardiac causes where your conduction system stops working Or you gradually get an enlarged heart and congestive heart failure Also there are swellings in your gut where your whole digestive tract loses its innervation and therefore there is severe constipation and bloating so serious that you have to have surgery and people can die of that symptom as well
    - Miller So what does this have to do with the blood supply in California
    - Wilson Well in Central and South America its mandatory to test the blood for Chagas disease because Chagas disease can be transmitted through the blood system as well and so the prevalence of Chagas in those countries is fairly high so its important that this not also be transmitted in the blood In Mexico its voluntary to test so they test a lot but not everything and in the United States there was no testing until just recently In December of last year a test was approved for the first time to be able to screen for Chagas in the blood supply and they began to test in about percent of the blood starting January first of this year So now our blood system is being tested
    - Miller So you were asked to determine the prevalence of Chagas within the blood supply
    - Wilson I started the study before this testing to try to identify what the risk might be of Chagas in the blood system to encourage testing actually We started the test a yearandahalf before the drug was approved and we surveyed patients in five blood systems in California and asked them about risk factors that they had in terms of where they lived and what kind of housing they were in because these bugs like to hide in thatched roofs or cracks in the wall and things like that and whether theyd received blood in those areas where they could have risk of contracting it that way or if they had a risk from birth from a mother who had Chagas because thats another way of transmitting
    - So we surveyed these people and identified what the risk would be based on where they lived essentially And then we also asked them a lot of other information about general health to identify if they had Chagas disease currently
    - And finally we looked at the costeffectiveness of different screening methods for implementing a blood testing system should this test which now has come to pass begin So we looked at those areas
    - Miller And what did you find
    - Wilson Well at the beginning when we just looked at the risk we looked at three kinds of blood system areas representing three types of locations One was in San Francisco which was sort of a mixed city and also in San Diego which is close to the border and so you would think would have a high risk of Hispanics or Latin Americans coming across the border and then we looked at a more agricultural area in Modesto and areas around there
    - And what we found was that the risk varied of course across these three sites but not necessarily how you would expect it to vary from the prevalence of Hispanics self identified in the community And so we found that San Diego was relatively high risk according to the survey questions but that the agricultural area was not very high and San Francisco was surprisingly high
    - Miller Why do you think that happened
    - Wilson The reason was primarily because everybody in the population is donating blood so some of the people in the agricultural areas were newer immigrants and were not yet donating blood whereas the longer someone has been here we think the more likely they are to donate blood and so therefore more established Hispanic communities are probably donating more So one thing is you cant assume from the population that thats also the population that is donating blood the other thing is there are many people from Latin America who consider themselves more of European descent and dont self identify as Hispanic and that may be the case in San Francisco area because most of the risk was from Latin America
    - And if youre from Latin America you probably have a higher risk of getting Chagas because its more prevalent there than if youre from Mexico So even thought there were fewer numbers of people with risk potential in SF they had a higher prevalence level of risk being from Latin America
    - Miller When you looked at all this data where you able to determine either a presumed degree of risk or an actual level of infection in the blood supply
    - Wilson Well we were only able with these survey instruments to get a level of presumed risk and then this level was compared with the levels that are being obtained now that testing has begun in January
    - Miller And are the two in correspondence or are the results of the real test not available yet
    - Wilson The very first test for the drug approval looked fairly low and much lower than what we had estimated When we looked just at people who lived or were born there then our risk level from these surveys was similar to the risk level in those early studies
    - But now it seems as theyre testing more people that the risk level has gone up and its something like one in seven thousand in Los Angeles and one in sort of in a state area around the US and thats something like Chagas positive people that have been found in the blood supply across the US from January to October
    - Miller So should we be reassured that these tests are keeping our blood supply safe and then theres costs associated with this obviously so if its determined that to prevent this from becoming lodged in the larger population do the people managing the blood distribution think the test was worth the cost
    - Wilson I think that theyre somewhat surprised that theyre getting high numbers in some cases even though with the increase in immigration people were beginning to get more and more concerned as the years went by But I think its very good that we are testing now and it should be remembered that what were looking at is donors who are positive and theyre donating blood that has the potential to pass on Chagas disease but not all of that blood will actually transmit the disease
    - Miller I want to clarify that right now so lets just assume that youre unlucky and you happen to get some blood from an infected donor is it automatically true that youre going to get the disease
    - Wilson No it isnt and we dont really know what the risk of transmission is it may be as low as percent I know in Latin America its as high as percent so were not certain whether its the same in those countries or a little bit different a little bit less maybe because the health of the people is better or something like that
    - So we dont know but we dont really want to transmit that in the blood system anyway
    - Miller Are there any other features of the study that we should know about that you found particularly interesting
    - Wilson I think whats important now is first of all not all blood centers are testing and individual blood centers are trying to decide whether to test and thats where our cost effectiveness study I think was important and also our result that you cant tell from the population around you what your real risk is so people that may think they have very low Hispanic rates according to that population study may in fact have some more risk than they know about So I dont think you should decide on that basis
    - In addition we found that when we looked at a very broad risk through a screening question which is just have you ever lived or traveled to South America or Mexico and were you born to a mother who has we found that about percent of the people say yes to that question So blood centers need to decide whether theyre going to test or not and how many people theyre going to test

    - Wilson Well many times people can self donate for themselves if its an elective surgery and thats always a good idea or have someone they know in the family to donate blood for them So thats one thing people are already doing when they can but many times you cannot do that and youre in a trauma situation and you just get blood In that situation I dont know if youre in a position to be asking that question
    - But I think its important for the public to be aware of this and maybe when theyre donating blood its important to be clear on what answers you give when youre donating as well and to mention this in blood donation centers as well

    paragraphs: 
    - Should a suspected terrorist be denied the right to take courses in biology and chemistry
    - Are students attitudes about science critical to a countrys future economic health
    - Who says girls cant do science
    - What is a healthy worrier and why should we care
    - It has been a heady few months for the state of knowing we call science From global heating to stem cell reprogramming science news some of it generated by UCSF discoveries has jammed the airwaves and filled our computer screens
    - But does quantity qualify as understanding Should we feel that a new age of enlightenment is upon us Can we declare reason victorious and retire from the field of battle in clean lab coats
    - You tell me Science Caf
    - We begin in the United Kingdom where an Iraqi national under surveillance for presumed terrorist activities is being denied the opportunity to take secondary schoollevel science courses The reason The human biology course contains basic information about disease transmission and includes a detailed examination of neurotoxins The chemistry lab also contains compounds and teaches techniques that could assist a terrorist act
    - Excuse me but has anyone heard of web search engines There is plenty of information in the public domain already Consider what a twominute search yielded about ricin
    - Castor beans are the fruits of the castor plant which grows in Asia the Middle East and southern Europe In northern countries it serves as an ornamental plant A few beans may contain a dose lethal for an adult Manufacturing of a crude ricin preparation is easy and sufficient for terroristic purposes Since it affects the mucous membranes of the mouth and the upper airways the eyes and even the unprotected skin an aerosol of any size of particle would harm people Employing affinity chromatography it is possible to isolate in a single step mg of pure ricin from g of castor beans
    - Isnt preventing knowledge a rather curious principle upon which to base policy
    - Most readers of the Nature News story seem to agree Absurd and paranoid were just two of the more printable reactions
    - What do you think Science Caf
    - While were on the subject of thinking what do you think is on the minds of American yearolds Apparently its not science The results from the Program for International Student Assessment PISA put American students in th place just ahead of the Slovak Republic among the countries represented Students in Finland topped the list Students in Mexico were at the bottom
    - Education Secretary Margaret Spellings called the results disappointing Of equal concern was a poll of the students around the world who took the test A mere percent said that they would be interested in a career involving science Does that include science writing I wonder and only percent expressed interest in a life dedicated to advanced science
    - The math results for US students were even worse rd place If th place is disappointing does that make rd place dismal
    - You tell me Science Caf
    - While were on the topic of American teenagers lets cheer the young women scientists who recently won the Siemens Competition in Math Science and Technology First place in the team category went to two Long Island teens who created a molecule that helps block the reproduction of drugresistant tuberculosis bacteria Another young woman won the individual category for her studies of bone growth in zebrafish
    - Guess they werent all watching High School Musical
    - Its also interesting to note how other countries sometimes slow to recognize the economic power of basic science are now spending a lot of money to catch up To wit two oncology institutes in Milan have signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Saudi Arabia to create a hospital and cancer research center at a new acre site known as King Abdullah City
    - Breast cancer is topic one on the research agenda As Nature News reports breast cancer has a high priority in Saudi Arabia where intermarriage within families has led to an aboveaverage rate of breast cancers with unusual genetic mutations
    - That leads to todays final entry culled from Forethought Grist in the Harvard Business Review The essay is titled What Health Consumers Want and it offers an insiders glimpse into how health care marketers can uncover areas of untapped value by analyzing demand
    - We are all health consumers of course and since science underlies most of the health we consume its interesting to note how science products are served up and to use the marketing term segmented
    - Healthy worriers are first on the Harvard list that also includes the unfit and happy and hapless heavyweights Now I completely understand the need to know your audience but I find the underlying assumptions embodied in these categories well curious
    - Heres what they have to say about the hapless heavyweights They resist yet feel incapable of improving their situations on their own Of all the segments this group needs the most external motivation including support groups and financial penalties
    - Financial penalties A good idea

    - Castor beans are the fruits of the castor plant which grows in Asia the Middle East and southern Europe In northern countries it serves as an ornamental plant A few beans may contain a dose lethal for an adult Manufacturing of a crude ricin preparation is easy and sufficient for terroristic purposes Since it affects the mucous membranes of the mouth and the upper airways the eyes and even the unprotected skin an aerosol of any size of particle would harm people Employing affinity chromatography it is possible to isolate in a single step mg of pure ricin from g of castor beans
    - Isnt preventing knowledge a rather curious principle upon which to base policy
    - Most readers of the Nature News story seem to agree Absurd and paranoid were just two of the more printable reactions
    - What do you think Science Caf
    - While were on the subject of thinking what do you think is on the minds of American yearolds Apparently its not science The results from the Program for International Student Assessment PISA put American students in th place just ahead of the Slovak Republic among the countries represented Students in Finland topped the list Students in Mexico were at the bottom
    - Education Secretary Margaret Spellings called the results disappointing Of equal concern was a poll of the students around the world who took the test A mere percent said that they would be interested in a career involving science Does that include science writing I wonder and only percent expressed interest in a life dedicated to advanced science
    - The math results for US students were even worse rd place If th place is disappointing does that make rd place dismal
    - You tell me Science Caf
    - While were on the topic of American teenagers lets cheer the young women scientists who recently won the Siemens Competition in Math Science and Technology First place in the team category went to two Long Island teens who created a molecule that helps block the reproduction of drugresistant tuberculosis bacteria Another young woman won the individual category for her studies of bone growth in zebrafish
    - Guess they werent all watching High School Musical
    - Its also interesting to note how other countries sometimes slow to recognize the economic power of basic science are now spending a lot of money to catch up To wit two oncology institutes in Milan have signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Saudi Arabia to create a hospital and cancer research center at a new acre site known as King Abdullah City
    - Breast cancer is topic one on the research agenda As Nature News reports breast cancer has a high priority in Saudi Arabia where intermarriage within families has led to an aboveaverage rate of breast cancers with unusual genetic mutations
    - That leads to todays final entry culled from Forethought Grist in the Harvard Business Review The essay is titled What Health Consumers Want and it offers an insiders glimpse into how health care marketers can uncover areas of untapped value by analyzing demand
    - We are all health consumers of course and since science underlies most of the health we consume its interesting to note how science products are served up and to use the marketing term segmented
    - Healthy worriers are first on the Harvard list that also includes the unfit and happy and hapless heavyweights Now I completely understand the need to know your audience but I find the underlying assumptions embodied in these categories well curious
    - Heres what they have to say about the hapless heavyweights They resist yet feel incapable of improving their situations on their own Of all the segments this group needs the most external motivation including support groups and financial penalties
    - Financial penalties A good idea

    title: "Heart of Hearts: A Conversation with Pediatric Cardiologist Harold Bernstein"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Did you realize that the muscle cells of your heart stopped dividing within weeks after you were born
    - Think about that for a moment
    - The heart of a newborn is about the size of a walnut An adult heart is the size of a fist If the heart is not adding new cells how does it get bigger
    - The answer says pediatric cardiologist Harold Bernstein MD PhD whose professional life spills from his research laboratory to patients rooms and back again is that the individual cells simply get larger
    - Unlike the hearts of amphibians human hearts do not possess the innate ability to repair themselves So when disease ravages this finite amount of heart muscle the heart has to do more with less to keep us alive or in the worst cases be replaced by a transplanted organ
    - Harold Bernstein
    - It is this finality that makes Bernsteins research on the developing heart so promising You see there is a brief window in the few weeks after birth when complicated heart surgery can be thoroughly successful Why The infant organ retains a degree of plasticity that allows it to remodel and rework itself Perform the same operation a few months later says Bernstein and the infant might never fully recover
    - Solving this profound mystery could be the key to an amazing array of new heart therapies And while Bernstein celebrates the potential benefits to patients you get the idea that finding out why hearts develop as they do will be just as exciting to him as figuring out how to make them whole again

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Harold Bernstein associate professor of pediatrics in cardiology a senior investigator in the Cardiovascular Research Institute a member of the Institute for Regeneration Medicine and a practicing pediatric cardiologist in the pediatric heart center Welcome Harold
    - Harold Bernstein Thank you
    - Miller A lot of titles when do you have time to breathe
    - Bernstein Its interesting its probably the most daunting aspect of the career of the physicianscientist to try to blend all of these interests and responsibilities but somehow it works
    - Miller So MB PhD a long training time how long in your case
    - Bernstein I think my first faculty position happened when I was so yeah quite a protracted time for education
    - Miller And do you advise this career choice for others
    - Bernstein Well I think it depends I think in my case it took that long for me to achieve what I needed to to get here I think certainly there are other routes to doing this I think certainly if you want to take care of patients you need a medical degree and I certainly have colleagues with medical degrees who do incredible research without having necessarily formally gotten a PhD but
    - Miller So you do you split your time between lab and seeing patients and if you do how do you split that up
    - Bernstein I probably spend percent of my time in the lab doing research and percent of my time involved in both patient care and medical teaching activities
    - Miller So lets think back a little bit on your childhood was this a career you could have imagined yourself doing Maybe there was someone in your family who was a scientist a doctor
    - Bernstein Actually not I grew up in a family where there werent any doctors of scientists although I have to say my father was a closet physicist
    - Miller How so
    - Bernstein He had studied physics in college even though he did not have a career in science When I was very young I remember us doing experiments in electricity and sound and light at home because he was just interested in that and even now at the age of he still sends me articles to read and has this insatiable intellectual curiosity
    - Miller So how did you end up in the field that youre currently in
    - Bernstein Certainly in college I had mentors or role models who really steered me towards biochemistry and molecular biology I remember sitting in an introductory biology class and having Walter Gelbert give a lecture where he basically said Im not going to talk about what I had scheduled because there was a recent article suggesting that the DNA sequences of mammalian genes are interrupted by entrons and we have no idea what these are And he then went on to expound for about minutes about this and I thought this was incredible I was watching something really important unfold and at that point I realized thats what I wanted to do I wanted to learn how things work and I wanted to be a scientist
    - Miller I did look at your resume and I notice you spent some time as an intern in UCSF working with the legendary Abe Rudolph so tell me about that experience
    - Bernstein By the time I started my clinical training I already knew that I wanted to practice pediatric cardiology and in fact one of the reasons that I sought out doing residency training in pediatrics here in UCSF was because Dr Rudolph was in care of pediatrics at the time and this would be the best place to come
    - Ive been very fortunate to have an ongoing mentoring relationship with him and in fact hes still a professor emeritus and his office is right across the hall and so
    - Miller You consult
    - Bernstein I happily get to see him couple of times during the week
    - Miller I know your field of research is the developing heart and the role of stem cells and perhaps some therapeutic advances so why dont you give me some general ideas about the thrust and the direction at this point
    - Bernstein Well I guess we became interested a big part of our endeavor is to use human embryonic stem cells to both model the development of heart muscle and to explore these cells as a potential therapy for damaged cardiac muscle And I think we were led down this path when a few years ago we were doing studies in muscle repair in the mouse and we realized that the way muscle is repaired in rodents actually is different than the way in which its repaired in humans and that in humans the stem cell repertoire in humans may actually be much broader and there may be much more opportunity in humans to take advantage of different stem cell populations which is much more restricted in the mouse
    - Miller Its true that the cardiac muscle cells stop dividing soon after birth correct
    - Bernstein Thats correct in both cases but it was at that point we realized that if we really wanted to explore something that would be valuable to humans we needed to work in a human system
    - And thats when we started to make the transition to really work with human embryonic stem cells as a tool both the study the development of heart muscle as well as how we might manipulate that to treat disease
    - Miller So what happens when a heart gets damaged and what might this potential therapy do to alleviate it
    - Bernstein What we find is that the adult heart and by adult I mean patients who are everything from several months old an infant to an adult like you and I when cardiac muscle is damaged there really is no inherent repair process that can replace the damaged muscle and so the heart is left with whatever living tissue has not been damaged
    - In some cases if that damage has been very small the heart does a good job of compensating But in many cases where the damage is severe the heart cant compensate and as a result it puts stress on the rest of the heart to work in a way its not meant to and over time that results in heart failure And currently aside from medications that can help relieve some of the symptoms of heart failure really the only definitive treatment we have is cardiac transplant
    - As a pediatric cardiologist we know that as limited as adults are for adult heart transplant recipients theyre even more limited in children which makes this an even more pressing issue in children who have sustained injury to their heart muscle
    - Miller And that injury might be as the result of some genetic defect or physical injury
    - Bernstein Probably the majority of pediatric patients that we see have had some damage to the heart due to either a viral infection that has caused inflammation and then resulting cardiac injury or someone who is born with defective muscle proteins and so theyre more prone to damage
    - Miller So it takes time for that to show
    - Bernstein But there is also a growing number of patients who had been born with abnormally structured hearts they have a congenital heart defect and they have undergone surgery to help palliate or improve their hearts function with that defect but they still dont have normal hearts and we find that those patients as they get older their hearts began to fail
    - Miller You said a growing number so I dont want to let that slip by why would the numbers be growing at this point
    - Bernstein Its interesting because its not growing because more patients are being born with these defects its growing because were getting better at saving them early in life So years ago these patients would have died as infants but over the past years as surgical and interventional techniques have improved weve been able to save these infants who have gone on to grow up to become children and young adults
    - And this is the population of patients with congenital heart disease that were now facing who have developing heart failure
    - Miller So when a heart is damaged is there a percentage of functionality that determines whether or not the heart can manage on its own or whether its severely compromised so is it percent or if you have to percent function thats going to be OK
    - Bernstein I think that in the adult population who start off with essentially normal hearts there are parameters that suggest when your heart is functioning at least at or percent of its capacity it can function fairly normally although it may be starting to trend towards failing In pediatrics it becomes much more complicated especially because these patients dont start off with normal pumping chambers and in some cases patients are born with a pumping chamber that really wasnt meant to do the job that we ask of it and so its hard to put a number on that
    - And so instead we really assess these patients in terms of what theyre able to do and whether their heart in particular is able to meet the demand thats placed on it by their activities
    - Miller How does a heart actually grow from a child to an adult size if their heart cells cannot regenerate or add How is it actually increasing in size
    - Bernstein What we know from studies mostly in mice and rats and then subsequently in some human studies is that somewhere midway through gestation so when youre about a week old fetus the cells comprising the heart muscles stop dividing They continue to divide to a certain extent but by the time youre born less than percent of those heart muscle cells are dividing and within about three weeks really an imperceptible number of dividing heart cells can be seen
    - When the average human baby is born its heart is about the size of a walnut and yet it has to grow into adulthood to the size of a fist And it does that predominately by each individual cell growing in size So the cell number doesnt increase but each cell itself grows in size
    - Miller Muscle up they all muscle up
    - Bernstein Thats essentially how the heart grows
    - Miller Why do you suppose in evolutionary terms heart cells were not given the capacity to regenerate
    - Bernstein Hmmm so whats the teleologyI would venture that heart cells are asked to do a lot of very specialized traits They need to conduct electricity and convert that electrical activity to mechanical activity in a synchronized fashion so that each cell together forms a functioning pump And so I suspect that because of that it would not be an easy matter for any of those highly specialized cells to dedifferentiate into a cell that could then expend a lot of energy dividing
    - On the other hand we know that in other eukaryotes
    - Miller Eukaryotes being
    - Bernstein Animals with more than one cell For example amphibians They have hearts as well that pump similar to ours however they are capable of regeneration Some fascinating studies were done in the s where amphibians were subjected to amputation of part of the pumping chamber They would observe those animals over time and see that they were able to completely regenerate that heart muscle over a period of about a week
    - And there are many investigators who are trying to understand what it is about the amphibian heart that allows it to do what the mammalian heart or the hearts of humans cats dogs mice and rats cannot do
    - Miller Does that information inform at all your work with stem cells when you think about how that might work in overcoming heart disease
    - Bernstein Its a little bit removed from the kind of work were doing with stem cells but I can tell you that what does inform our work with stem cells is what we observed in new born infants versus what we see in adults This is where insights into development and insights that those of us who are pediatric cardiologists have really come into play
    - We know that patients who are born with congenital heart defects when we do surgery to repair hearts within the first two to three weeks of life the ability of their heart muscle to repair and remodel and assume normal function as best as we can measure is really quite incredible Those patients do phenomenally well
    - On the other hand when patients with very similar defects are missed in terms of diagnosis until they are older even just a matter of several months and they have similar surgeries for these defects they have a much rockier postoperative course In some cases their heart muscle may never actually come up to the level of functioning that we see in infants
    - Miller So whats going on there
    - Bernstein Thats where the idea that theres some plasticity that remains very early in life as a remnant of in utero development before youre born that is quickly lost after youre born and its one of the reasons why we think we may be able to find the answer by looking at development of a cardiac muscle cell from an embryonic stem cell Because thats effectively the same developmental pathway that were seeing in infants
    - Miller And in working with those cells you have to be able to determine what signals help them differentiate correct
    - Bernstein Yes
    - Miller And how close are you to that
    - Bernstein That I think is one of the essential questions at least in the field of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiac muscle cells We know that using fairly straight forward techniques we can take pluri potent human ES cells and they will differentiate into cardiac muscle cells And well find that up to about percent of those ES cells will become cardiac muscle cells However in a dish when we differentiate them we see that they become all different types of cardiac muscle cells
    - And without getting too detailed about the different types of cells you find in the heart some of the cells act like the muscle cells in the pumping chambers some act like the cells in the muscle collecting chambers some act like the electrical cells but its a very varied group of cells without any kind of organization
    - So we know that theres an inherent genetic programming that allows these cells to become one of these types of cells but we know that in real life this is not a random process and that in the majority of cases cells develop appropriately depending on where they are in the heart So I think one of the key questions is what guides that
    - Miller They migrate to a spot and then differentiate
    - Bernstein We dont know So one of the questions were trying to answer which I think is fundamental to understanding myocardial development is what is the contribution of inherent genetic programming and what is the contribution to the tissue environment in determining what kind of heart muscle cell youre going to become
    - Miller Whats your guess
    - Bernstein My guess is that its both a question of tissue environment and the time during development that the cell is exposed to the tissue environment that will predict what kind of cell it becomes And I think this is where it becomes not only an essential question to the biology of understanding development but also an essential question if were going to develop therapy
    - Because if we want to take human cardiomyocites derived from stem cells and we want to use them to repair damaged myocardium we have to pick them at a time when theyre at that point in development when theyre still susceptible to environmental cues we have to find the right way to deliver them to the damaged area we have to find the right way to have the tissue environment be able to communicate to the cell in order to incorporate it into the heart and to have it help
    - So theyre a lot of issues that need to be solved The piece were looking at is at what point in development is the cell still susceptible to those tissue cues We collaborate with a number of other groups here in UCSF who are looking at other aspects of those questions that need to be answered before were able to really provide cell based therapy for heart disease
    - Miller You mentioned delivery systems What would you imagine might actually work
    - Bernstein Well right now and again this is work being done by some of our collaborators right now most of the delivery systems that are being used are direct injection And whether that means opening up the chest and directly injecting cells into the damaged heart area or using ultrasound to guide a needle to go through the chest without opening it to the correct area are the main ways that people are using to deliver cells that they hope will become cardiomyocytes
    - Another very promising approach has been to use bone marrow derived stem cells which can be delivered basically through a blood transfusion and then looking to them to home towards areas that have been damaged and repair them
    - Some of the clinical trials that are being done elsewhere have shown that there is some effect to using bone marrow derived cells the exact component of bone marrow derived stem cells is not known whether these cells actually become new muscle cells or merely create an environment conducive to new blood vessel growth and just sort of a beefing up of the area or whether these cells participate in decreasing scar formation is really not known but other groups are studying this
    - Miller As you know theres been a lot of hype about stem cells so again Im curious when we talk about lets move from pediatrics to adult for a second adult heart disease heart attacks do you foresee a day when this type of therapy might actually be able to regenerate and repair large areas of a damaged heart
    - Bernstein I think so Im very optimistic that the kinds of work being done both in basic research as well as in the clinical trials are leading us there I would say that on a nearterm horizon the use of stem cells especially human embryonic stem cells is really the first chance weve had to have a system we can study in a culture dish that really mimics cardiac development in humans so in the nearterm I suspect these cells will be very useful for screening drugs for example
    - But I do believe that within the next to years we will really see cell based therapy using stem cells in the treatment of heart disease
    - Miller And how long might it take again in the fantasy world were talking about right now for a therapy like that to work Lets say someone has a massive heart attack and a large percentage of the heart is damaged Lets say there was a therapy available I know Im putting you on the spot but would this work in a matter of days weeks months or what do you suspect
    - Bernstein Let me first challenge the way you pose the question because I think someone whos had a massive heart attack where the majority of the heart is damaged I dont think were going to be able to treat that with cell based therapy and so I dont think were going to see cardiac transplant completely disappear But I think in places where people have sustained enough damage so that their heart is still functioning but they start to deteriorate due to heart failure I think those are the patients were going to have the biggest impact on
    - As far as how long it will take boy thats a really hard question to know I think that in the studies that are being done now people are really looking at improvements in function after several months And generally looking at the sixmonth horizon as a time point to see whether a therapy has had any effect
    - Miller Fair enough Do you think the public over emphasizes the ability of stem cells to fix a lot of problems
    - Bernstein I can only talk to heart disease and I dont think that the public enthusiasm for the use of stem cells in the treatment of heart diseases is unwarranted I think the public is correct in being very optimistic there It has been suggested that stem cells are going to cure many things I cant really comment on those
    - Miller What do you think the public gets most confused by in the whole stem cell question we can confine it to heart disease Weve established that it can be done youre hopeful about that we know that theyre a lot of people around the country doing research similar to yours theres funding so maybe on a more technical side is it the belief that this can happen quickly because more moneys being thrown at it Would that be one example
    - Bernstein One of what I think is a misconception is that there is a population of adult stem cells that reside in the heart that can be used to repair the heart And the reason that I think thats a misconception is not that those cells dont exist I think thats been demonstrated But theres a lot of emphasis from groups who do not believe we should be doing work with human embryonic stem cells on the use of adult stem cells for this kind of disease
    - And unfortunately while adult stemlike cells have been identified in hearts of adults the question of whether they could really be used in therapy or rather theyre a remnant of development much like our appendix is in the gastrointestinal tract really is unknown
    - And certainly one would suspect that if they were capable of any kind of repair we would see that process and we really dont So I think it is somewhat of a misconception that there are significant enough advances made with adult stem cells to treat heart disease such that we dont need to use embryonic stem cells
    - On the other hand theres been some very recent exciting data suggesting that we may be able to use skin cells and reprogram these cells to become heart cells However as exciting as that data is that work still is in fairly early stages and methods will need to be developed to insure that enough of those cells can be turned into heart muscle cells and that those heart muscle cells are normal and would function and be able to integrate into the heart before we put all other research into other cell types aside
    - Miller Last question the term regeneration is that really an accurate term to use regarding all the stem cell research
    - Bernstein I think that when people think about this term of medicine they think about organs that have a native capacity to regenerate like the liver or they think about animal studies as we mentioned before with amphibians I think what were really looking at is therapy
    - Because it may turn out that our ability to use cells to improve heart function may not come down to actually regenerating muscle it may come down to using cells to create an environment that helps the heart handle the stress of the damage thats been done to it in a better way And frankly whether we create cell therapy that replaces muscle or we create adult therapy that improves heart function by another means really doesnt matter The bottom line is we want to use cells to try to improve the lives of patients who have heart failure
    - Miller Harold thank you for joining me on Science Caf we wish you great success
    - Bernstein Thank you my pleasure

    - Bernstein What we find is that the adult heart and by adult I mean patients who are everything from several months old an infant to an adult like you and I when cardiac muscle is damaged there really is no inherent repair process that can replace the damaged muscle and so the heart is left with whatever living tissue has not been damaged
    - In some cases if that damage has been very small the heart does a good job of compensating But in many cases where the damage is severe the heart cant compensate and as a result it puts stress on the rest of the heart to work in a way its not meant to and over time that results in heart failure And currently aside from medications that can help relieve some of the symptoms of heart failure really the only definitive treatment we have is cardiac transplant
    - As a pediatric cardiologist we know that as limited as adults are for adult heart transplant recipients theyre even more limited in children which makes this an even more pressing issue in children who have sustained injury to their heart muscle
    - Miller And that injury might be as the result of some genetic defect or physical injury
    - Bernstein Probably the majority of pediatric patients that we see have had some damage to the heart due to either a viral infection that has caused inflammation and then resulting cardiac injury or someone who is born with defective muscle proteins and so theyre more prone to damage
    - Miller So it takes time for that to show
    - Bernstein But there is also a growing number of patients who had been born with abnormally structured hearts they have a congenital heart defect and they have undergone surgery to help palliate or improve their hearts function with that defect but they still dont have normal hearts and we find that those patients as they get older their hearts began to fail
    - Miller You said a growing number so I dont want to let that slip by why would the numbers be growing at this point
    - Bernstein Its interesting because its not growing because more patients are being born with these defects its growing because were getting better at saving them early in life So years ago these patients would have died as infants but over the past years as surgical and interventional techniques have improved weve been able to save these infants who have gone on to grow up to become children and young adults
    - And this is the population of patients with congenital heart disease that were now facing who have developing heart failure
    - Miller So when a heart is damaged is there a percentage of functionality that determines whether or not the heart can manage on its own or whether its severely compromised so is it percent or if you have to percent function thats going to be OK
    - Bernstein I think that in the adult population who start off with essentially normal hearts there are parameters that suggest when your heart is functioning at least at or percent of its capacity it can function fairly normally although it may be starting to trend towards failing In pediatrics it becomes much more complicated especially because these patients dont start off with normal pumping chambers and in some cases patients are born with a pumping chamber that really wasnt meant to do the job that we ask of it and so its hard to put a number on that
    - And so instead we really assess these patients in terms of what theyre able to do and whether their heart in particular is able to meet the demand thats placed on it by their activities
    - Miller How does a heart actually grow from a child to an adult size if their heart cells cannot regenerate or add How is it actually increasing in size
    - Bernstein What we know from studies mostly in mice and rats and then subsequently in some human studies is that somewhere midway through gestation so when youre about a week old fetus the cells comprising the heart muscles stop dividing They continue to divide to a certain extent but by the time youre born less than percent of those heart muscle cells are dividing and within about three weeks really an imperceptible number of dividing heart cells can be seen
    - When the average human baby is born its heart is about the size of a walnut and yet it has to grow into adulthood to the size of a fist And it does that predominately by each individual cell growing in size So the cell number doesnt increase but each cell itself grows in size
    - Miller Muscle up they all muscle up
    - Bernstein Thats essentially how the heart grows
    - Miller Why do you suppose in evolutionary terms heart cells were not given the capacity to regenerate
    - Bernstein Hmmm so whats the teleologyI would venture that heart cells are asked to do a lot of very specialized traits They need to conduct electricity and convert that electrical activity to mechanical activity in a synchronized fashion so that each cell together forms a functioning pump And so I suspect that because of that it would not be an easy matter for any of those highly specialized cells to dedifferentiate into a cell that could then expend a lot of energy dividing
    - On the other hand we know that in other eukaryotes
    - Miller Eukaryotes being
    - Bernstein Animals with more than one cell For example amphibians They have hearts as well that pump similar to ours however they are capable of regeneration Some fascinating studies were done in the s where amphibians were subjected to amputation of part of the pumping chamber They would observe those animals over time and see that they were able to completely regenerate that heart muscle over a period of about a week
    - And there are many investigators who are trying to understand what it is about the amphibian heart that allows it to do what the mammalian heart or the hearts of humans cats dogs mice and rats cannot do
    - Miller Does that information inform at all your work with stem cells when you think about how that might work in overcoming heart disease
    - Bernstein Its a little bit removed from the kind of work were doing with stem cells but I can tell you that what does inform our work with stem cells is what we observed in new born infants versus what we see in adults This is where insights into development and insights that those of us who are pediatric cardiologists have really come into play
    - We know that patients who are born with congenital heart defects when we do surgery to repair hearts within the first two to three weeks of life the ability of their heart muscle to repair and remodel and assume normal function as best as we can measure is really quite incredible Those patients do phenomenally well
    - On the other hand when patients with very similar defects are missed in terms of diagnosis until they are older even just a matter of several months and they have similar surgeries for these defects they have a much rockier postoperative course In some cases their heart muscle may never actually come up to the level of functioning that we see in infants
    - Miller So whats going on there
    - Bernstein Thats where the idea that theres some plasticity that remains very early in life as a remnant of in utero development before youre born that is quickly lost after youre born and its one of the reasons why we think we may be able to find the answer by looking at development of a cardiac muscle cell from an embryonic stem cell Because thats effectively the same developmental pathway that were seeing in infants
    - Miller And in working with those cells you have to be able to determine what signals help them differentiate correct
    - Bernstein Yes
    - Miller And how close are you to that
    - Bernstein That I think is one of the essential questions at least in the field of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiac muscle cells We know that using fairly straight forward techniques we can take pluri potent human ES cells and they will differentiate into cardiac muscle cells And well find that up to about percent of those ES cells will become cardiac muscle cells However in a dish when we differentiate them we see that they become all different types of cardiac muscle cells
    - And without getting too detailed about the different types of cells you find in the heart some of the cells act like the muscle cells in the pumping chambers some act like the cells in the muscle collecting chambers some act like the electrical cells but its a very varied group of cells without any kind of organization
    - So we know that theres an inherent genetic programming that allows these cells to become one of these types of cells but we know that in real life this is not a random process and that in the majority of cases cells develop appropriately depending on where they are in the heart So I think one of the key questions is what guides that
    - Miller They migrate to a spot and then differentiate
    - Bernstein We dont know So one of the questions were trying to answer which I think is fundamental to understanding myocardial development is what is the contribution of inherent genetic programming and what is the contribution to the tissue environment in determining what kind of heart muscle cell youre going to become
    - Miller Whats your guess
    - Bernstein My guess is that its both a question of tissue environment and the time during development that the cell is exposed to the tissue environment that will predict what kind of cell it becomes And I think this is where it becomes not only an essential question to the biology of understanding development but also an essential question if were going to develop therapy
    - Because if we want to take human cardiomyocites derived from stem cells and we want to use them to repair damaged myocardium we have to pick them at a time when theyre at that point in development when theyre still susceptible to environmental cues we have to find the right way to deliver them to the damaged area we have to find the right way to have the tissue environment be able to communicate to the cell in order to incorporate it into the heart and to have it help
    - So theyre a lot of issues that need to be solved The piece were looking at is at what point in development is the cell still susceptible to those tissue cues We collaborate with a number of other groups here in UCSF who are looking at other aspects of those questions that need to be answered before were able to really provide cell based therapy for heart disease
    - Miller You mentioned delivery systems What would you imagine might actually work
    - Bernstein Well right now and again this is work being done by some of our collaborators right now most of the delivery systems that are being used are direct injection And whether that means opening up the chest and directly injecting cells into the damaged heart area or using ultrasound to guide a needle to go through the chest without opening it to the correct area are the main ways that people are using to deliver cells that they hope will become cardiomyocytes
    - Another very promising approach has been to use bone marrow derived stem cells which can be delivered basically through a blood transfusion and then looking to them to home towards areas that have been damaged and repair them
    - Some of the clinical trials that are being done elsewhere have shown that there is some effect to using bone marrow derived cells the exact component of bone marrow derived stem cells is not known whether these cells actually become new muscle cells or merely create an environment conducive to new blood vessel growth and just sort of a beefing up of the area or whether these cells participate in decreasing scar formation is really not known but other groups are studying this
    - Miller As you know theres been a lot of hype about stem cells so again Im curious when we talk about lets move from pediatrics to adult for a second adult heart disease heart attacks do you foresee a day when this type of therapy might actually be able to regenerate and repair large areas of a damaged heart
    - Bernstein I think so Im very optimistic that the kinds of work being done both in basic research as well as in the clinical trials are leading us there I would say that on a nearterm horizon the use of stem cells especially human embryonic stem cells is really the first chance weve had to have a system we can study in a culture dish that really mimics cardiac development in humans so in the nearterm I suspect these cells will be very useful for screening drugs for example
    - But I do believe that within the next to years we will really see cell based therapy using stem cells in the treatment of heart disease
    - Miller And how long might it take again in the fantasy world were talking about right now for a therapy like that to work Lets say someone has a massive heart attack and a large percentage of the heart is damaged Lets say there was a therapy available I know Im putting you on the spot but would this work in a matter of days weeks months or what do you suspect
    - Bernstein Let me first challenge the way you pose the question because I think someone whos had a massive heart attack where the majority of the heart is damaged I dont think were going to be able to treat that with cell based therapy and so I dont think were going to see cardiac transplant completely disappear But I think in places where people have sustained enough damage so that their heart is still functioning but they start to deteriorate due to heart failure I think those are the patients were going to have the biggest impact on
    - As far as how long it will take boy thats a really hard question to know I think that in the studies that are being done now people are really looking at improvements in function after several months And generally looking at the sixmonth horizon as a time point to see whether a therapy has had any effect
    - Miller Fair enough Do you think the public over emphasizes the ability of stem cells to fix a lot of problems
    - Bernstein I can only talk to heart disease and I dont think that the public enthusiasm for the use of stem cells in the treatment of heart diseases is unwarranted I think the public is correct in being very optimistic there It has been suggested that stem cells are going to cure many things I cant really comment on those
    - Miller What do you think the public gets most confused by in the whole stem cell question we can confine it to heart disease Weve established that it can be done youre hopeful about that we know that theyre a lot of people around the country doing research similar to yours theres funding so maybe on a more technical side is it the belief that this can happen quickly because more moneys being thrown at it Would that be one example
    - Bernstein One of what I think is a misconception is that there is a population of adult stem cells that reside in the heart that can be used to repair the heart And the reason that I think thats a misconception is not that those cells dont exist I think thats been demonstrated But theres a lot of emphasis from groups who do not believe we should be doing work with human embryonic stem cells on the use of adult stem cells for this kind of disease
    - And unfortunately while adult stemlike cells have been identified in hearts of adults the question of whether they could really be used in therapy or rather theyre a remnant of development much like our appendix is in the gastrointestinal tract really is unknown
    - And certainly one would suspect that if they were capable of any kind of repair we would see that process and we really dont So I think it is somewhat of a misconception that there are significant enough advances made with adult stem cells to treat heart disease such that we dont need to use embryonic stem cells
    - On the other hand theres been some very recent exciting data suggesting that we may be able to use skin cells and reprogram these cells to become heart cells However as exciting as that data is that work still is in fairly early stages and methods will need to be developed to insure that enough of those cells can be turned into heart muscle cells and that those heart muscle cells are normal and would function and be able to integrate into the heart before we put all other research into other cell types aside
    - Miller Last question the term regeneration is that really an accurate term to use regarding all the stem cell research
    - Bernstein I think that when people think about this term of medicine they think about organs that have a native capacity to regenerate like the liver or they think about animal studies as we mentioned before with amphibians I think what were really looking at is therapy
    - Because it may turn out that our ability to use cells to improve heart function may not come down to actually regenerating muscle it may come down to using cells to create an environment that helps the heart handle the stress of the damage thats been done to it in a better way And frankly whether we create cell therapy that replaces muscle or we create adult therapy that improves heart function by another means really doesnt matter The bottom line is we want to use cells to try to improve the lives of patients who have heart failure
    - Miller Harold thank you for joining me on Science Caf we wish you great success
    - Bernstein Thank you my pleasure

    paragraphs: 
    - Play movie
    - Good science takes time And even after years of work success is never guaranteed Thats why there is both relief and joy in the lab of Sloveniaborn Andrej Sali PhD a professor in the School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences
    - In November Sali coauthored two papers in the journal Nature While the titles are a bit esoteric Determining the Nature of Macromolecular Assemblies and Molecular Architecture of the Nuclear Pore Complex their implications are rockstar huge In short after eight years Sali and his colleagues have created software that takes information gathered from different sources such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry Xray crystallography and electron microscopy to calculate the structure of protein complexes
    - Why is this important Well in the case of the one big protein assembly known as the nuclear pore complex Salis software called IMP for integrated modeling platform determined the positions of all proteins not just their overall shapes in real time
    - Keep in mind that proteins are fluid and dynamic moving in a combined quadrille and quickstep Seeing all the moves as they happen which is Salis accomplishment is essential to understanding the underlying choreography
    - In this grand ballet the nuclear pore complex is the first dancer it is the gateway in and out of the cell Knowing how to open and close that gate is a key piece of information for potential drug makers And since function follows form Salis work has laid bare the details
    - It is precisely the kind of computational wizardry that Sali came to UCSF to perform And in finding likeminded colleagues in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences otherwise known as QB as well as in the School of Pharmacy Sali has added new intellectual weight to an already critical mass

    - Miller Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Andrej Sali professor and vice chair of the department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and a faculty affiliate of the California Institute of Biosciences otherwise known as QB here at Mission Bay Welcome Andrej
    - Sali Thank you
    - Miller Well when I read department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences or faculty affiliate of QB I dont really know exactly what that means so could you tell me what is it you do everyday
    - Sali Well you come in the morning and you have a day that consists mostly of meetings with other scientists primarily those in your own research group students and postdocs and you try to give advice and you try to learn from them
    - Miller What do you like best about your work
    - Sali I actually think its the very meetings I described Its talking about the scientific projects youre involved in with the people who are executing them planning for this research and writing it up in scientific papers which are hopefully then published I think its that process of planning and doing science that is most attractive which is why most of the scientists are in science
    - There are unfortunately a lot of other things that are necessary such as raising money to fund all of this that by itself is not really pleasurable at least not for me but is kind of necessary
    - Miller I know youre a protein guy right
    - Sali Thats correct
    - Miller So why UCSF and why among all the many things you could have chosen to study did you choose to come here and then to study protein structure as well
    - Sali Ill take the second part first why proteins Im not sure I really know the answer why I know that I was interested in proteins from high school on I worked in a local lab in Slovenia Im originally from Slovenia As a high school student I headed my own project which had to do with proteins in lab as well as on the computer and it was always proteins theyre just such an amazing combination of complexity and simplicity
    - Miller I have to ask you is there anyone in your family who was a scientist
    - Sali My father has been a professor of psychology at the local university
    - Miller He didnt influence your love of proteins
    - Sali I dont think so There was a biology textbook if I think even further back that we used in high school which was based on an American program in biology I remember the introduction of the textbook used to educate Americans in the sciences and one result of that was a great series of textbooks and we used them
    - This was Yugoslavia then and it was just the most amazing textbook And perhaps the love of proteins comes from that
    - Miller Were going to talking a lot about proteins with you here today but at the beginning if we can get the numbers straight how many proteins are there in the human body do we know
    - Sali We know approximately that the human genome codes for about twentyfive thousand or so proteins but many of them are then modified after theyre expressed and so you have a number of different versions of the same protein encoded by the same gene so the number is in excess of twentyfive thousandBut its also true that at any given moment in time in any given cell only a subset of them are really expressed So perhaps you have only an order of of so proteins that will exist and act at any given moment in any given cell
    - Miller You mentioned the human genome I remember when the number of genes first came out for humans approximately some were surprised that it was so low But isnt it true that its the protein interactions that really allow for all this sophisticated development within humans
    - Sali Absolutely I think thats exactly right The complexity and you can see in biology or in evolutionif you study evolutionhow complexity arises not so much from the number of genes or proteins that an organism encodes and uses but from the interactions between these proteins and also actually from the interactions between proteins and other molecules such as nucleic acids as well as various small molecules be it substrates or regulators and inhibitors of the activities
    - So definitely a lot of complexity arises from the interactions between the components not from the sheer number of components only
    - Miller So do we have any idea about how proteins actually evolved it might not be a fair question it might not be your field but Im always curious
    - Sali No no it is a very relevant question and one can describe many aspects of protein evolution from comparison of proteins from different organisms Present day organisms and you can in fact infer to a significant degree at least in some situations the exact changes or almost the exact changes in nucleic acid sequences that resulted in the present day versions of proteins from the ancestors in the distant past maybe hundreds of millions of years ago
    - In fact a lot can be learned from comparison of say the human genome and the mouse genome the human genome and primate genome Its a very fruitful area of biology thats very informative about not just how we came to be what we are but also about how the present day proteins function
    - Miller Do we know what the first protein was
    - Sali I dont think so
    - Miller The mother or the father protein we dont have that
    - Sali There was almost certainly many more than one they were probably small single domain very stable proteins but exactly what they were Im not sure well ever know
    - Miller Can we guess that maybe that the function of proteins has something to do with the energy needs of living organisms or is that not related at all
    - Sali That is definitely one of the major functions involved in generating the energy or the molecules that store the energy that is then used in other processes in the organism also regulated by proteins but its just one of their functions
    - Other major functions include even just the structural framework for the organism of the cell whole organism as well as regulation of all sorts of processes such as conversion of genes into proteins ultimately There are inhibitor proteins that inhibit processes There are enzymes that catalyze processes Theres a very large variety of different kinds of functions and reactions that proteins are involved in
    - Miller I know proteins were the center of two November papers in the journal Nature let me read the titles here one was Determining the Nature of Macromolecular Assemblies and Molecular Architecture of the Nuclear Pore Complex and then there was a Nature review in December The Molecular Sociology of the Cell but before we get into detail about those I just want to spend a second to secure in peoples minds the dynamism of the cell
    - I think sometimes the public because they see static representations of cells and cell activity and cell proteins they think of this as a fixed and static process when in fact its quite a dynamic one if Im reading this all correctly And that theres this constant communication and interaction Thats really the hard thing to disentangle And thats really one of the aims of your research correct
    - Sali Yes I think that youre absolutely right proteins are dynamic entities all sorts of levels and all sorts of different time scales You have individual atoms fluctuating around their average or equilibrium positions then you have larger parts of proteins moving with same structural elements for example moving with respect to each other in one protein molecule And then you have of course sometimes the whole protein unfolding for example when its degraded by some other protein protease in that case or you can also have whole protein molecules coming together and falling apart in larger complexes So you have all those dynamic processes many of which are important for their functions some may be coincidental but many of them are important for function and certainly we would like to have computational models for describing all these dynamics and models that allow us to regulate the dynamics as well as exploit it
    - Miller So for those that dont know could you explain what a computational model is
    - Sali There are different kinds of computational models some of them will allow you to incorporate information from experimental sources experimental methods that people generate in a lab As they incorporate that information they will also generate some answers that are not directly observable in the lab about the system youre interested in about the protein youre interested in For example in structures that can be determined that way you measure certain aspects of the structure in crystallography that will be structure factors perhaps phases or estimated phases and then you would get out of that an indirect set of observations the actual threedimensional structure of the protein You need a computational model to allow you to convert the data into the structure
    - Thats one kind Another kind of model and this classification is totally arbitrary I suppose is totally selfcontained where you actually dont rely at least not directly on any measurements about the system youre interested in but you have enough physics and perhaps enough statistical inferences you incorporate it into the model so that you can do everything that you want to do predict the structure as opposed to determine it or simulate the motions as opposed to measure them You do this entirely on computer
    - Miller And this is all about being able to see the proteins
    - Sali Yes exactly One can obtain a very explicit microscopic picture of protein structures as well as how they change in time with such methods Its another question how accurate these pictures are but with time theyre getting more accurate and hopefully
    - Miller Its seeing them in real time these are moving and changing and interacting all the time
    - Sali Thats exactly right yes
    - Miller And the seeing them tells you what
    - Sali It depends on each case I suppose
    - Miller And when we talk about seeing them the data can be interpreted to computer images
    - Sali Thats usually the case In the old days when computer graphics was not powerful enough people would build physical models of protein structures from plastics but thats not really done anymore so its all on the computer screen And theres very powerful software that exists for such tasks
    - Actually one particular program that we like to use is called Chimera and its being developed by Tom Ferrins group here at UCSF Many other people use it too So its possible to do that on a computer screen and it is an amazing property of structural biology that in some sense its justified to have almost a belief a blind belief that when you see a protein structure for the first time you will have an insight or a set of insights into how it acts how it evolved How you might interfere with it that you cant even imagine before you know what the structure is
    - Miller Is that true
    - Sali In many cases its true its not always true
    - Miller So you just see it and something clicks
    - Sali Thats exactly right
    - Miller Based on your knowledge of other proteins perhaps
    - Sali That could be involved Its very difficult to be algorithmic about it or to have a specific set of rules exactly how to proceed but theres a variety of possible insights and by seeing the structure one frequently has them its just an empirical fact One of the very beautiful features of structural biology is that function does depend on the form and if you know the form youre in good shape to get an insight into function
    - Miller OK as long as were talking about form lets just say Im sitting next to you on a plane and I realize that youre one of the coauthors of this paper on the nuclear pore complex how are you going to
    - Sali Not likely to happen laughter
    - Miller Lets just say hypothetically speaking so what are you going to tell me that is going to make me get excited about knowing the structure of the nuclear pore complex
    - Sali A number of things You see the structure existing in the shape of a ring with a hole in the middle and that ring in fact sits in the nuclear envelope which defines the boundaries of the nucleus And all of because you know that most of the traffic micro molecular traffic in and out of the nucleus goes through the nuclear pore complex you can begin studying that hole in the middle of the ring in terms of the mechanism of transport
    - Miller Things get in and go out
    - Sali Through this gate of the nucleus so called And because you now have the structure you can understand that there is transport factors involved in carrying the cargo molecules in and out through the ring you can begin to model the process quantitatively Again in the computer Hopefully informed by experiments that determine interactions between at least some of the components of the system
    - But basically you are in a position to start describing quantitatively and then perhaps regulating the transport of different macromolecules differentially through the pore In and out of the nucleus And because its obviously very key to the function of the cell whats in and out of the nucleus you can imagine all sorts of basic biology as well as biomedical applications
    - Miller Before we get into the potential biomedical applications I just want to make sure you get credit for your role in this process in this study which if I understand it correctly there are a lot of clues from these various technologies that infer or demonstrate what the potential shape is Your role was to actually design software that was able to integrate all this information and then to come up with a proposed shape and eliminate a lot of other possibilities Is that why people are so excited
    - Sali I would say thats one of the reasons well I hope thats one of the reasons why people are excited But it is absolutely true that the structure that was determined was determined based on experimental information about the nuclear pore complex And that experimental information was of many different types and was generated over the course of many years or so by our collaborators in Rockefeller University New York City and students and post docs in their labs The information it generated was very difficult to obtain and they generated a lot of it and should be another reason why people should be excited about this whole thing
    - So when you put the two together the way to generate this kind of information and the software that allows you to convert information into an explicit threedimensional structure then you have a whole approach that should be hopefully applicable to many other complexes
    - Miller And you were the software conversion group
    - Sali And we developed the method and implemented it into software and applied it with our friends to this specific system of nuclear pore complex
    - Miller You mentioned earlier about potential biomedical applications so what might some of this lead to And you can speculate wildly thats OK
    - Sali Of course I have to preface what Im saying that it takes more than ten years on the average to develop a drug even when you are successful so we havent started as far as I know nobody has really started with any kind of a rational approach to designing drugs based on knowing the structure of the nuclear pore complex But one can speculate that perhaps if one can interfere with import or export of certain protein molecules in or out of the nucleus you could achieve certain biomedical outcomes that are desirable
    - And Ill stick my neck out I have to read more about the subject but I understand the Leptomycin B one of the antibiotics that might be used in the near future coincidentally does interfere with transport of p protein thats involved in cell cycle regulation and whose malfunction may result in cancer
    - There is a way to use Leptomycin B to keep more of the p inside the nucleus and therefore benefit from its regulative role to help treat cancer that way So one can imagine more gains of this nature where either good players are camped inside the nucleus or more of them are pumped into the nucleus through judicious interference with the transport process made possible by really detailed understanding of how the transport through the NPC works
    - Which in turn of course is made possible by knowing the structure of the NPC
    - Miller Weve talked a lot about interactions so before I go I want to ask is it possible to imagine being able to actually influence on protein or a proteinprotein interaction without creating some cascade effect with a lot of unintended consequences
    - Sali Well thats certainly a big problem that were almost always faced with I suppose In drug discovery you develop molecule hopefully that interacts or maybe usually inhibits a particular protein enzyme usually but it almost never does It has broader interactivity and then there are all sorts of side effects as a result
    - So similarly maybe more so one would expect the specificity problems when youre dealing with proteinprotein interactions and its just something that one has to be aware of and do the most to minimize or maximize sometimes maybe youd like to have a broad spectrum a small molecule or a broad spectrum impact on proteinprotein interactions but it is an issue thats combinatorial sotospeak in its nature and problematic and difficult to handle
    - Miller So Whats next for you now that this project is done if in fact it is done
    - Sali Oh its not done laughter Always for one question answered there are ten more new questions I think in this case we certainly want to get a highresolution structure of the NPC we want to develop data use data that our friends can measure in the lab about the transport through the NPC and incorporate this data into again a quantitative model in a computer we want to describe the evolution of the nuclear pore complex more accurately Weve done some work on that already with some intriguing findings but theres more to do Theres the question of how does the whole complex assemble proteins how do they come together when they first meet so to speak and then for us theres always the need to generalize the computational method and apply it to as many other complexes perhaps in collaboration with other biologists as we can
    - Miller Well now I truly know what youll be doing everyday Thank you for joining us on Science Caf congratulations on this work and good luck in the future
    - Sali Thank you very much

    - Good science takes time And even after years of work success is never guaranteed Thats why there is both relief and joy in the lab of Sloveniaborn Andrej Sali PhD a professor in the School of Pharmacys Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences
    - In November Sali coauthored two papers in the journal Nature While the titles are a bit esoteric Determining the Nature of Macromolecular Assemblies and Molecular Architecture of the Nuclear Pore Complex their implications are rockstar huge In short after eight years Sali and his colleagues have created software that takes information gathered from different sources such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry Xray crystallography and electron microscopy to calculate the structure of protein complexes
    - Why is this important Well in the case of the one big protein assembly known as the nuclear pore complex Salis software called IMP for integrated modeling platform determined the positions of all proteins not just their overall shapes in real time
    - Keep in mind that proteins are fluid and dynamic moving in a combined quadrille and quickstep Seeing all the moves as they happen which is Salis accomplishment is essential to understanding the underlying choreography
    - In this grand ballet the nuclear pore complex is the first dancer it is the gateway in and out of the cell Knowing how to open and close that gate is a key piece of information for potential drug makers And since function follows form Salis work has laid bare the details
    - It is precisely the kind of computational wizardry that Sali came to UCSF to perform And in finding likeminded colleagues in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences otherwise known as QB as well as in the School of Pharmacy Sali has added new intellectual weight to an already critical mass

    - Miller Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Andrej Sali professor and vice chair of the department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and a faculty affiliate of the California Institute of Biosciences otherwise known as QB here at Mission Bay Welcome Andrej
    - Sali Thank you
    - Miller Well when I read department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences or faculty affiliate of QB I dont really know exactly what that means so could you tell me what is it you do everyday
    - Sali Well you come in the morning and you have a day that consists mostly of meetings with other scientists primarily those in your own research group students and postdocs and you try to give advice and you try to learn from them
    - Miller What do you like best about your work
    - Sali I actually think its the very meetings I described Its talking about the scientific projects youre involved in with the people who are executing them planning for this research and writing it up in scientific papers which are hopefully then published I think its that process of planning and doing science that is most attractive which is why most of the scientists are in science
    - There are unfortunately a lot of other things that are necessary such as raising money to fund all of this that by itself is not really pleasurable at least not for me but is kind of necessary
    - Miller I know youre a protein guy right
    - Sali Thats correct
    - Miller So why UCSF and why among all the many things you could have chosen to study did you choose to come here and then to study protein structure as well
    - Sali Ill take the second part first why proteins Im not sure I really know the answer why I know that I was interested in proteins from high school on I worked in a local lab in Slovenia Im originally from Slovenia As a high school student I headed my own project which had to do with proteins in lab as well as on the computer and it was always proteins theyre just such an amazing combination of complexity and simplicity
    - Miller I have to ask you is there anyone in your family who was a scientist
    - Sali My father has been a professor of psychology at the local university
    - Miller He didnt influence your love of proteins
    - Sali I dont think so There was a biology textbook if I think even further back that we used in high school which was based on an American program in biology I remember the introduction of the textbook used to educate Americans in the sciences and one result of that was a great series of textbooks and we used them
    - This was Yugoslavia then and it was just the most amazing textbook And perhaps the love of proteins comes from that
    - Miller Were going to talking a lot about proteins with you here today but at the beginning if we can get the numbers straight how many proteins are there in the human body do we know
    - Sali We know approximately that the human genome codes for about twentyfive thousand or so proteins but many of them are then modified after theyre expressed and so you have a number of different versions of the same protein encoded by the same gene so the number is in excess of twentyfive thousandBut its also true that at any given moment in time in any given cell only a subset of them are really expressed So perhaps you have only an order of of so proteins that will exist and act at any given moment in any given cell
    - Miller You mentioned the human genome I remember when the number of genes first came out for humans approximately some were surprised that it was so low But isnt it true that its the protein interactions that really allow for all this sophisticated development within humans
    - Sali Absolutely I think thats exactly right The complexity and you can see in biology or in evolutionif you study evolutionhow complexity arises not so much from the number of genes or proteins that an organism encodes and uses but from the interactions between these proteins and also actually from the interactions between proteins and other molecules such as nucleic acids as well as various small molecules be it substrates or regulators and inhibitors of the activities
    - So definitely a lot of complexity arises from the interactions between the components not from the sheer number of components only
    - Miller So do we have any idea about how proteins actually evolved it might not be a fair question it might not be your field but Im always curious
    - Sali No no it is a very relevant question and one can describe many aspects of protein evolution from comparison of proteins from different organisms Present day organisms and you can in fact infer to a significant degree at least in some situations the exact changes or almost the exact changes in nucleic acid sequences that resulted in the present day versions of proteins from the ancestors in the distant past maybe hundreds of millions of years ago
    - In fact a lot can be learned from comparison of say the human genome and the mouse genome the human genome and primate genome Its a very fruitful area of biology thats very informative about not just how we came to be what we are but also about how the present day proteins function
    - Miller Do we know what the first protein was
    - Sali I dont think so
    - Miller The mother or the father protein we dont have that
    - Sali There was almost certainly many more than one they were probably small single domain very stable proteins but exactly what they were Im not sure well ever know
    - Miller Can we guess that maybe that the function of proteins has something to do with the energy needs of living organisms or is that not related at all
    - Sali That is definitely one of the major functions involved in generating the energy or the molecules that store the energy that is then used in other processes in the organism also regulated by proteins but its just one of their functions
    - Other major functions include even just the structural framework for the organism of the cell whole organism as well as regulation of all sorts of processes such as conversion of genes into proteins ultimately There are inhibitor proteins that inhibit processes There are enzymes that catalyze processes Theres a very large variety of different kinds of functions and reactions that proteins are involved in
    - Miller I know proteins were the center of two November papers in the journal Nature let me read the titles here one was Determining the Nature of Macromolecular Assemblies and Molecular Architecture of the Nuclear Pore Complex and then there was a Nature review in December The Molecular Sociology of the Cell but before we get into detail about those I just want to spend a second to secure in peoples minds the dynamism of the cell
    - I think sometimes the public because they see static representations of cells and cell activity and cell proteins they think of this as a fixed and static process when in fact its quite a dynamic one if Im reading this all correctly And that theres this constant communication and interaction Thats really the hard thing to disentangle And thats really one of the aims of your research correct
    - Sali Yes I think that youre absolutely right proteins are dynamic entities all sorts of levels and all sorts of different time scales You have individual atoms fluctuating around their average or equilibrium positions then you have larger parts of proteins moving with same structural elements for example moving with respect to each other in one protein molecule And then you have of course sometimes the whole protein unfolding for example when its degraded by some other protein protease in that case or you can also have whole protein molecules coming together and falling apart in larger complexes So you have all those dynamic processes many of which are important for their functions some may be coincidental but many of them are important for function and certainly we would like to have computational models for describing all these dynamics and models that allow us to regulate the dynamics as well as exploit it
    - Miller So for those that dont know could you explain what a computational model is
    - Sali There are different kinds of computational models some of them will allow you to incorporate information from experimental sources experimental methods that people generate in a lab As they incorporate that information they will also generate some answers that are not directly observable in the lab about the system youre interested in about the protein youre interested in For example in structures that can be determined that way you measure certain aspects of the structure in crystallography that will be structure factors perhaps phases or estimated phases and then you would get out of that an indirect set of observations the actual threedimensional structure of the protein You need a computational model to allow you to convert the data into the structure
    - Thats one kind Another kind of model and this classification is totally arbitrary I suppose is totally selfcontained where you actually dont rely at least not directly on any measurements about the system youre interested in but you have enough physics and perhaps enough statistical inferences you incorporate it into the model so that you can do everything that you want to do predict the structure as opposed to determine it or simulate the motions as opposed to measure them You do this entirely on computer
    - Miller And this is all about being able to see the proteins
    - Sali Yes exactly One can obtain a very explicit microscopic picture of protein structures as well as how they change in time with such methods Its another question how accurate these pictures are but with time theyre getting more accurate and hopefully
    - Miller Its seeing them in real time these are moving and changing and interacting all the time
    - Sali Thats exactly right yes
    - Miller And the seeing them tells you what
    - Sali It depends on each case I suppose
    - Miller And when we talk about seeing them the data can be interpreted to computer images
    - Sali Thats usually the case In the old days when computer graphics was not powerful enough people would build physical models of protein structures from plastics but thats not really done anymore so its all on the computer screen And theres very powerful software that exists for such tasks
    - Actually one particular program that we like to use is called Chimera and its being developed by Tom Ferrins group here at UCSF Many other people use it too So its possible to do that on a computer screen and it is an amazing property of structural biology that in some sense its justified to have almost a belief a blind belief that when you see a protein structure for the first time you will have an insight or a set of insights into how it acts how it evolved How you might interfere with it that you cant even imagine before you know what the structure is
    - Miller Is that true
    - Sali In many cases its true its not always true
    - Miller So you just see it and something clicks
    - Sali Thats exactly right
    - Miller Based on your knowledge of other proteins perhaps
    - Sali That could be involved Its very difficult to be algorithmic about it or to have a specific set of rules exactly how to proceed but theres a variety of possible insights and by seeing the structure one frequently has them its just an empirical fact One of the very beautiful features of structural biology is that function does depend on the form and if you know the form youre in good shape to get an insight into function
    - Miller OK as long as were talking about form lets just say Im sitting next to you on a plane and I realize that youre one of the coauthors of this paper on the nuclear pore complex how are you going to
    - Sali Not likely to happen laughter
    - Miller Lets just say hypothetically speaking so what are you going to tell me that is going to make me get excited about knowing the structure of the nuclear pore complex
    - Sali A number of things You see the structure existing in the shape of a ring with a hole in the middle and that ring in fact sits in the nuclear envelope which defines the boundaries of the nucleus And all of because you know that most of the traffic micro molecular traffic in and out of the nucleus goes through the nuclear pore complex you can begin studying that hole in the middle of the ring in terms of the mechanism of transport
    - Miller Things get in and go out
    - Sali Through this gate of the nucleus so called And because you now have the structure you can understand that there is transport factors involved in carrying the cargo molecules in and out through the ring you can begin to model the process quantitatively Again in the computer Hopefully informed by experiments that determine interactions between at least some of the components of the system
    - But basically you are in a position to start describing quantitatively and then perhaps regulating the transport of different macromolecules differentially through the pore In and out of the nucleus And because its obviously very key to the function of the cell whats in and out of the nucleus you can imagine all sorts of basic biology as well as biomedical applications
    - Miller Before we get into the potential biomedical applications I just want to make sure you get credit for your role in this process in this study which if I understand it correctly there are a lot of clues from these various technologies that infer or demonstrate what the potential shape is Your role was to actually design software that was able to integrate all this information and then to come up with a proposed shape and eliminate a lot of other possibilities Is that why people are so excited
    - Sali I would say thats one of the reasons well I hope thats one of the reasons why people are excited But it is absolutely true that the structure that was determined was determined based on experimental information about the nuclear pore complex And that experimental information was of many different types and was generated over the course of many years or so by our collaborators in Rockefeller University New York City and students and post docs in their labs The information it generated was very difficult to obtain and they generated a lot of it and should be another reason why people should be excited about this whole thing
    - So when you put the two together the way to generate this kind of information and the software that allows you to convert information into an explicit threedimensional structure then you have a whole approach that should be hopefully applicable to many other complexes
    - Miller And you were the software conversion group
    - Sali And we developed the method and implemented it into software and applied it with our friends to this specific system of nuclear pore complex
    - Miller You mentioned earlier about potential biomedical applications so what might some of this lead to And you can speculate wildly thats OK
    - Sali Of course I have to preface what Im saying that it takes more than ten years on the average to develop a drug even when you are successful so we havent started as far as I know nobody has really started with any kind of a rational approach to designing drugs based on knowing the structure of the nuclear pore complex But one can speculate that perhaps if one can interfere with import or export of certain protein molecules in or out of the nucleus you could achieve certain biomedical outcomes that are desirable
    - And Ill stick my neck out I have to read more about the subject but I understand the Leptomycin B one of the antibiotics that might be used in the near future coincidentally does interfere with transport of p protein thats involved in cell cycle regulation and whose malfunction may result in cancer
    - There is a way to use Leptomycin B to keep more of the p inside the nucleus and therefore benefit from its regulative role to help treat cancer that way So one can imagine more gains of this nature where either good players are camped inside the nucleus or more of them are pumped into the nucleus through judicious interference with the transport process made possible by really detailed understanding of how the transport through the NPC works
    - Which in turn of course is made possible by knowing the structure of the NPC
    - Miller Weve talked a lot about interactions so before I go I want to ask is it possible to imagine being able to actually influence on protein or a proteinprotein interaction without creating some cascade effect with a lot of unintended consequences
    - Sali Well thats certainly a big problem that were almost always faced with I suppose In drug discovery you develop molecule hopefully that interacts or maybe usually inhibits a particular protein enzyme usually but it almost never does It has broader interactivity and then there are all sorts of side effects as a result
    - So similarly maybe more so one would expect the specificity problems when youre dealing with proteinprotein interactions and its just something that one has to be aware of and do the most to minimize or maximize sometimes maybe youd like to have a broad spectrum a small molecule or a broad spectrum impact on proteinprotein interactions but it is an issue thats combinatorial sotospeak in its nature and problematic and difficult to handle
    - Miller So Whats next for you now that this project is done if in fact it is done
    - Sali Oh its not done laughter Always for one question answered there are ten more new questions I think in this case we certainly want to get a highresolution structure of the NPC we want to develop data use data that our friends can measure in the lab about the transport through the NPC and incorporate this data into again a quantitative model in a computer we want to describe the evolution of the nuclear pore complex more accurately Weve done some work on that already with some intriguing findings but theres more to do Theres the question of how does the whole complex assemble proteins how do they come together when they first meet so to speak and then for us theres always the need to generalize the computational method and apply it to as many other complexes perhaps in collaboration with other biologists as we can
    - Miller Well now I truly know what youll be doing everyday Thank you for joining us on Science Caf congratulations on this work and good luck in the future
    - Sali Thank you very much

    title: "Gravity-Free: A Conversation with Cell Growth Space Scientist Millie Hughes-Fulford"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Millie HughesFulford
    - Outer space envelops us in a cold and bright mystery
    - For some like Millie HughesFulford PhD director of the Laboratory of Cell Growth at the UCSFaffiliated San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center this mystery has lured them off the planet into a weightless world heavy with adventure
    - But even the most ardent astronaut or wouldbe astronaut must accept the reality of human evolution We are earthbound life forms sculpted by the elemental force called gravity
    - HughesFulford who was the first woman scientist to ride in the space shuttle in has long been a world leader in exploring what happens to our immune system and our bone cells when suddenly thrust into a gravityfree environment Its not a pretty picture From bone loss to infections humans in space seem fragile creatures And indeed extended space travel to distant planets let alone the creation of a moon base seems far too risky without doing our homework as HughesFulford continually insists
    - Still this native Texan remains optimistic about the value of both space travel and space science Apart from humanitys innate impulse for literally looking over the next horizon an impulse she heartily endorses HughesFulford touts the spinoff effect From osteoporosis to AIDS what she has learned in space benefits disease researchers on the planets surface too
    - That is in keeping with her world view that in the end everything is connected

    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf today Im here with Millie HughesFulford director of the Laboratory of Cell Growth also known as the HughesFulford Lab at the UCSFaffiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center welcome Millie
    - HughesFulford Its great to be here Jeff
    - Miller Millies also a former space shuttle astronaut on what turned out to be the illfated Columbia she studies among other things the effects of weightlessness on the human immune system So my first question is why that and not something else
    - HughesFulford Well as a child I was a big space buff I love science fiction and at yearsold I thought I wanted to be a space cadet or an astronautthey didnt exist back then by the wayand I saw all of the Apollo astronauts Mercury astronauts and it wasnt until I was older that I realized none of them were women laughter
    - Miller Truethey seem to be always the exotic planetary princesses or something but not astronauts
    - HughesFulford Not astronauts so long story made short I became a scientist and a chance came that I could put my hat in the ring to be an astronaut and I was lucky enough to be chosen and I got very interested in looking at the diseases associated with space flight and theyre mainly in the areas of osteoporosis and Immunosuppression
    - So thats how I got started on my road to looking at the body systems that seem to depend on gravity for normal function
    - Miller You were selected for that original space mission as a space scientist
    - HughesFulford As a space scientist
    - Miller Was that the first time that scientists studying these types of things have been included in missions
    - HughesFulford We actually had on Space Lab Owen Garriott and a few European scientists fly I was the first woman scientist to fly on the shuttle
    - Miller And what year was that so we can get our chronology correct
    - HughesFulford OK it was on STS it was
    - Miller Youve mentioned Immunosuppression and osteoporosis so lets start with the bone part I know youve done a lot of experiments can you kind of summarize the types of experiments youve run in space and then what youve learned
    - HughesFulford The first one was on STS where we smuggled aboard on a commercial flight some bone cells to look at what happens to bone cells in space flight and what we found was that they did not grow as quickly and that their internal skeleton called the saddle skeleton didnt form properly in space flight
    - Miller Was that a surprise
    - HughesFulford That was a surprise It was the first time anyone showed that the saddle skeleton was abnormal in space flight And later other people found that to be true in the immune cells
    - So anyway after STS we were able to fly bone experiments on three flights and what we found was that the bone cells are not making the normal bone growth factors they normally make those are down we had on board a G centrifuge so the cells that were in a gravity field made those growth factors normally so it was a matter of gravity
    - We have found that in some cases we can add back those factors and get the cells to grow normally so we kind of have a handle on
    - Miller You can add back those factors while in space or
    - HughesFulford in simulations So basically the bone cells need gravity to perform properly and in some cases you can do a lot of resistance exercise and cut down the bone loss On Apollo they lost in two weeks an average of percent on Skylab in days one guy lost I think seven and a half percent of his bone and then on space station Mir we had people who were up for six months and one individual lost percent of his bone and he did not recover it
    - Miller Even back on earth
    - HughesFulford Even back on earth it did not recover Yet we have other people that did not lose any bone so it must be something in the differences between people it must be the genetics involved that the genotypes the people were different so we really need to do some homework on who is losing the bone whos not losing the bone and the counter measures that we need to do the keep the bones healthy especially on the moon where we only have onesixth the gravity and of course a trip to Mars
    - Miller We havent yet talked about the immune system so lets talk about those experiments and what youve learned
    - HughesFulford On Apollo of the astronauts had some type of infection either during the flight or immediately upon return Thats a pretty big number for healthy people There are also studies done on white blood cells and it was found that they were not activating properly specifically the Tcell
    - Dr Augusto Colgaly was the first to show that the isolated white blood cell did not proliferate when stimulated in the microgravity environment thus showing that gravity was required for normal Tcell activation Now weve done some studies since that time with Augusto and have found its probably one of the IO receptors thats not being turned on
    - We have another experiment coming up next September where were actually going to be able to look at the early signaling and find out why the Tcell is not being activated
    - Miller And this experiment is going to take place
    - HughesFulford On ISS International Space Station I think this time its going to go up on shuttle thats what we hear
    - Miller On a US Shuttle
    - HughesFulford On a US Shuttle All of the other experiments have had to go on European space agency projects that meant we had to go to Russia and to Kazakhstan to do our work
    - Miller To the former Soviet space site ground zero
    - HughesFulford Thats right the Russians have I think a year lease with the Kazakhstans to be able to launch but for right now its a long way to get to Kazakhstan to do your work
    - Miller Have you launched with the European space agency these experiments once or twice
    - HughesFulford Twice We just got back from the second time in October where we put an experiment with monocytes up there There are two cells that are affected by space one are the Tcells and the other are the monocytes In general what the monocyte does is it is the guardian of the body it matures into a cell called the macrophage which means big eater and what happens is the macrophage eats bacteria And so when you get an infection the macrophage is eating it Literally it recognizes it and eats it
    - But what happens in space flight weve seen in returning astronauts that the monocyte itself theres fewer of them and that fewer of those are being turned into macrophages so theyre not maturing properly So the experiment that we did in October was we took then on a site put it in space then we activated it to turn into a macrophage and so were looking at the gene expression of that
    - Miller So is it the absence of gravity thats really at the root of all this
    - HughesFulford We believe it to be the absence of gravity on the European flights were able to have a sample thats in a G centrifuge and so we actually can know what happens in a gravity situation versus space flight Or macrogravity
    - Miller So were revealing I guess as products of earthbound evolution the impact of gravity on how weve
    - HughesFulford Evolved yes
    - Miller So thats whats happening here You mentioned the moon earlier so I know a moon base is planned and I know youve been somewhat outspoken about the need to take certain measures so tell me about that
    - HughesFulford Well since we have of the Apollo astronauts that became ill during the Apollo program we know that theres a possibility that well see that same Immunosuppression on a moon base And so my concern is we havent really done all our homework in finding out why the Tcells are not being activated and of course on the moon theres a lot of moon dust and during Apollo they found that the moon dust would get in the air it got all over them
    - So we would have to control the dust for one thing you dont want the dust in the air and people breathing it in that might have bacteria attached to it the other thing is the moon dust is very sharp actually on some of the suits that came back from the Apollo astronauts they were worn because it was more like an abrasive and anyplace they would have movement it would just saw into the fabric
    - And so you dont want people breathing that in
    - Miller So what measures are being taken as plans take shape for this moon base
    - HughesFulford Well hopefully by now theyre putting in a lot of filters and a lot of fans to keep the dust down I havent seen the plans lately in the beginning I know they werent really considering how to maintain it but I think they are beginning to think about it now
    - Miller And with the immunosuppression the risk then is if someone gets sick then everybody gets sick
    - HughesFulford Its in the air right
    - Miller and that could devastate the whole group of people who are studying and living and working there
    - HughesFulford I think that we just need to do our homework find out A how much gravity do you need for your Tcell to normally activate I dont know We havent done the work How do you keep the moon dust off of things because it has some static electrical properties that tends to cling to people Theres a picture of one of the Apollo astronauts that looks like hes got black on his face its moon dust So I think its real important we start looking at these things and do our homework before we get there
    - Miller I could envision what an exercise space on a moon base might look like as a gravity countermeasure but when we talk about a longer space flight like to the planet Mars how does that work
    - HughesFulford I think all of us have seen the movies with the spacecrafts with rotating centrifuges inside like I think thats the best way to do it create an artificial gravity So far I havent seen any space vehicles being designed that had that built into them
    - Miller For reasons of cost or for other reasons
    - HughesFulford Oh it takes a lot of energy if you have a centrifuge going one direction its kind of like a top itll be going in another direction youre causing a force to get off orbit so you need two of them going in opposite directions to stay in your flight path So that cost money to run but again the question is do you need it hours or do you just need an hour of it a day to keep everything normal
    - Miller And we dont have the answers to that question yet
    - HughesFulford I dont know No one knows So I think doing a little bit of homework might save us a lot of money
    - HughesFulford Oh Im a big fan of the robotics guys JPL big fan We need robotics We need to go We need to find more about Mars do we have water on Mars its going to make it a lot easier to live on Mars So I think we really need robotics to do our homework with
    - And then I think we need to go into space but I think we need better propulsion were still using the same oldfashioned propulsion they were using in World War II
    - Miller The technologys not improved at all since then
    - HughesFulford I dont think its changed a bit
    - Miller We dont have any bright young engineering students studying propulsion
    - HughesFulford Well you would have to have a program to help support them People have to eat and they have to have a place to sleep You can have great ideas but you still have to live And unless we have programs to promote new thoughts and to take us into new areas its not going to happen
    - Miller And youre saying these programs dont exist
    - HughesFulford I havent seen a lot of them I would like to see engineering schools get grants to do forward thinking and then pick the best ideas and then fund them I do know there is a plasma drive being worked on in Costa Rica
    - Miller In Costa Rica by whom
    - HughesFulford I think its Chang Diaz a former astronaut who is working on it And I think theyre making some progress on it and a plasma drive would only take about a month to get to Mars instead of nine months so that would reduce the amount of radiation exposure reduce the amount of damage from not being in a gravity field itd be much better
    - Miller Is it realistic for us to assume that were going to inhabit other planets Thats a little out of your field I realize but youve been an astronaut so lets speculate
    - HughesFulford I believe that we as a people as a planet will explore Its in the nature of mankind I think it would take the entire population of the planet to really start thinking about going to another planet or going to another galaxy and I think it would take a lot more technology and development than what we have right now
    - But yes I dont see any reason that by we would be doing that Theres probably a warp drive engineer out there a young kid or one yet to be born Yes absolutely
    - Miller Fair enough Early in the space program on one of its enduring facets was this spinoff s into consumer culture and other things Since youre in the field of health Im wondering these things youre learning are their going to be more benefits for more earthbound needs
    - HughesFulford I think so I think if you look at the spinoffs we had already from NASA remote monitoring and ICUs was a shoot off of what NASA did Velcro of course as we all know A lot of the remote technology in medicine was originally done by NASA and it was spunoff
    - What we think were going to get back from basic studies of the immune system is that were able to turn off certain signal pathways in microgravity that we cant do in other situations And so were learning more about how immune cells work and once you know what part of the systems not turning on and what that does then you can target that system to turn on
    - So I think we can do a lot with the knowledge that were getting back from space flight
    - Miller So that might be a benefit to those with immunosuppressive diseases perhaps
    - HughesFulford Absolutely
    - Miller And how about osteoporosis
    - HughesFulford Again right now we dont know the origin of osteoporosis in space flight we know that its probably due to the lack of gravity There have been some cases where people on Mir were exercising for four hours at a time and they still lost bone It might be in the genetics of the person themselves but we do know that gravity is involved and we do know that not having gravity means that were going to have to do more resistance exercise and so forth but to really know how to turn on new osteoblast growth I think thats the next step in the treatment of osteoporosis
    - We need an anabolic or a constructive treatment so we can rebuild bone rather than just keeping it from being destroyed
    - Miller I know that in addition to the things weve discussed you have some other research interests as well and you recently got a grant for stem cells
    - HughesFulford Yes we are looking at the possibility of growing stem cells in a more rapid manner and turning them into new bone cells for osteoblast and then looking at mineralizing them And its being supported by the DOD and we just heard that we most likely have a VA grant coming in to look at a similar project using stems cells and repair of bone
    - Miller And you have done earlier work in prostate cancer can you tell us about that
    - HughesFulford In prostate cancer I was interested in how the different fatty acids affected prostate cancer As you know in this country we have a lot of Omega fatty acids that we intake and were not eating as many Omega s thats fish oils from nuts we dont graze our cattle anymore theyre cornfed so they have a lot of Omega in them and looking at the ratios we can manipulate in the laboratory the ratio of Omega to Omega and control the growth of tumors in tissue culture
    - Miller So more Omega much less Omega
    - HughesFulford Absolutely Early man had to
    - Miller And whats the ratio today do you suppose
    - HughesFulford About to
    - Miller Omega to Omega Id say thats disproportionate there
    - HughesFulford It is Its very important we keep looking at this Were writing grants its not like Im not writing grants to do the prostate cancer work its just that theres not as much funding right now Im lucky in that I have several grants that will keep me alive but the funding at the NIH is way down NASA funding is down by about percent in the life sciences so were in a period of time when the government is not supporting science like it did
    - Miller What is the connection we have prostate cancer immune systems issues bone growth is there some connection to all these things
    - HughesFulford Probably an inability to focus no thats not true laughter I look at systems and what makes systems work And if Im looking at an immune cell or a bone cell or a cancer cell Im looking at what makes it grow
    - The cancer cell I dont want it to grow The bone cell I want it to grow The immune cell I want it to grow but its the same system So you can think of me as a systems engineer I want to find out what makes things work
    - Miller While I have you here I want to talk a little bit about women in science You are yourself a very successful woman scientist and I wonder if those that youve encountered in your lab recently complain about some of the same things you might have encountered in your career some discrimination or has it all faded now
    - HughesFulford Well we are in California and California is a fairly liberal place to be a woman scientist I havent seen a lot of blatant discrimination at all I think its a fairly level playing field right now at least here
    - Miller How about earlier in your career was there a nurturing father or some relative who helped to guide you along the scientific pathway
    - HughesFulford It was my father Absolutely And of all the female astronauts Ive ever talked to it was their father that was encouraging to them So to the fathers that are listening to this you create your daughters destiny
    - Miller Were there some particular words that you recall
    - HughesFulford He was always there I remember one day in third grade I was working on some word problems in math was having trouble he came in we owned a supermarket and he was on his feet twelve hours a day and now I know how tired he had to be when he walked in back then you didnt know and he said whats wrong
    - I said I was having trouble he said come and sit on my knee and well work through it together Thats what I remember
    - Miller Thats a very wonderful memory thank you for sharing it and thank you for joining me today on Science Caf I wish you great luck in future research efforts and hope to be reading about new and exciting developments
    - HughesFulford Thank you Jeff and thanks for inviting me

    paragraphs: 
    - Millie HughesFulford
    - Outer space envelops us in a cold and bright mystery
    - For some like Millie HughesFulford PhD director of the Laboratory of Cell Growth at the UCSFaffiliated San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center this mystery has lured them off the planet into a weightless world heavy with adventure
    - But even the most ardent astronaut or wouldbe astronaut must accept the reality of human evolution We are earthbound life forms sculpted by the elemental force called gravity
    - HughesFulford who was the first woman scientist to ride in the space shuttle in has long been a world leader in exploring what happens to our immune system and our bone cells when suddenly thrust into a gravityfree environment Its not a pretty picture From bone loss to infections humans in space seem fragile creatures And indeed extended space travel to distant planets let alone the creation of a moon base seems far too risky without doing our homework as HughesFulford continually insists
    - Still this native Texan remains optimistic about the value of both space travel and space science Apart from humanitys innate impulse for literally looking over the next horizon an impulse she heartily endorses HughesFulford touts the spinoff effect From osteoporosis to AIDS what she has learned in space benefits disease researchers on the planets surface too
    - That is in keeping with her world view that in the end everything is connected

    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller welcome to Science Caf today Im here with Millie HughesFulford director of the Laboratory of Cell Growth also known as the HughesFulford Lab at the UCSFaffiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center welcome Millie
    - HughesFulford Its great to be here Jeff
    - Miller Millies also a former space shuttle astronaut on what turned out to be the illfated Columbia she studies among other things the effects of weightlessness on the human immune system So my first question is why that and not something else
    - HughesFulford Well as a child I was a big space buff I love science fiction and at yearsold I thought I wanted to be a space cadet or an astronautthey didnt exist back then by the wayand I saw all of the Apollo astronauts Mercury astronauts and it wasnt until I was older that I realized none of them were women laughter
    - Miller Truethey seem to be always the exotic planetary princesses or something but not astronauts
    - HughesFulford Not astronauts so long story made short I became a scientist and a chance came that I could put my hat in the ring to be an astronaut and I was lucky enough to be chosen and I got very interested in looking at the diseases associated with space flight and theyre mainly in the areas of osteoporosis and Immunosuppression
    - So thats how I got started on my road to looking at the body systems that seem to depend on gravity for normal function
    - Miller You were selected for that original space mission as a space scientist
    - HughesFulford As a space scientist
    - Miller Was that the first time that scientists studying these types of things have been included in missions
    - HughesFulford We actually had on Space Lab Owen Garriott and a few European scientists fly I was the first woman scientist to fly on the shuttle
    - Miller And what year was that so we can get our chronology correct
    - HughesFulford OK it was on STS it was
    - Miller Youve mentioned Immunosuppression and osteoporosis so lets start with the bone part I know youve done a lot of experiments can you kind of summarize the types of experiments youve run in space and then what youve learned
    - HughesFulford The first one was on STS where we smuggled aboard on a commercial flight some bone cells to look at what happens to bone cells in space flight and what we found was that they did not grow as quickly and that their internal skeleton called the saddle skeleton didnt form properly in space flight
    - Miller Was that a surprise
    - HughesFulford That was a surprise It was the first time anyone showed that the saddle skeleton was abnormal in space flight And later other people found that to be true in the immune cells
    - So anyway after STS we were able to fly bone experiments on three flights and what we found was that the bone cells are not making the normal bone growth factors they normally make those are down we had on board a G centrifuge so the cells that were in a gravity field made those growth factors normally so it was a matter of gravity
    - We have found that in some cases we can add back those factors and get the cells to grow normally so we kind of have a handle on
    - Miller You can add back those factors while in space or
    - HughesFulford in simulations So basically the bone cells need gravity to perform properly and in some cases you can do a lot of resistance exercise and cut down the bone loss On Apollo they lost in two weeks an average of percent on Skylab in days one guy lost I think seven and a half percent of his bone and then on space station Mir we had people who were up for six months and one individual lost percent of his bone and he did not recover it
    - Miller Even back on earth
    - HughesFulford Even back on earth it did not recover Yet we have other people that did not lose any bone so it must be something in the differences between people it must be the genetics involved that the genotypes the people were different so we really need to do some homework on who is losing the bone whos not losing the bone and the counter measures that we need to do the keep the bones healthy especially on the moon where we only have onesixth the gravity and of course a trip to Mars
    - Miller We havent yet talked about the immune system so lets talk about those experiments and what youve learned
    - HughesFulford On Apollo of the astronauts had some type of infection either during the flight or immediately upon return Thats a pretty big number for healthy people There are also studies done on white blood cells and it was found that they were not activating properly specifically the Tcell
    - Dr Augusto Colgaly was the first to show that the isolated white blood cell did not proliferate when stimulated in the microgravity environment thus showing that gravity was required for normal Tcell activation Now weve done some studies since that time with Augusto and have found its probably one of the IO receptors thats not being turned on
    - We have another experiment coming up next September where were actually going to be able to look at the early signaling and find out why the Tcell is not being activated
    - Miller And this experiment is going to take place
    - HughesFulford On ISS International Space Station I think this time its going to go up on shuttle thats what we hear
    - Miller On a US Shuttle
    - HughesFulford On a US Shuttle All of the other experiments have had to go on European space agency projects that meant we had to go to Russia and to Kazakhstan to do our work
    - Miller To the former Soviet space site ground zero
    - HughesFulford Thats right the Russians have I think a year lease with the Kazakhstans to be able to launch but for right now its a long way to get to Kazakhstan to do your work
    - Miller Have you launched with the European space agency these experiments once or twice
    - HughesFulford Twice We just got back from the second time in October where we put an experiment with monocytes up there There are two cells that are affected by space one are the Tcells and the other are the monocytes In general what the monocyte does is it is the guardian of the body it matures into a cell called the macrophage which means big eater and what happens is the macrophage eats bacteria And so when you get an infection the macrophage is eating it Literally it recognizes it and eats it
    - But what happens in space flight weve seen in returning astronauts that the monocyte itself theres fewer of them and that fewer of those are being turned into macrophages so theyre not maturing properly So the experiment that we did in October was we took then on a site put it in space then we activated it to turn into a macrophage and so were looking at the gene expression of that
    - Miller So is it the absence of gravity thats really at the root of all this
    - HughesFulford We believe it to be the absence of gravity on the European flights were able to have a sample thats in a G centrifuge and so we actually can know what happens in a gravity situation versus space flight Or macrogravity
    - Miller So were revealing I guess as products of earthbound evolution the impact of gravity on how weve
    - HughesFulford Evolved yes
    - Miller So thats whats happening here You mentioned the moon earlier so I know a moon base is planned and I know youve been somewhat outspoken about the need to take certain measures so tell me about that
    - HughesFulford Well since we have of the Apollo astronauts that became ill during the Apollo program we know that theres a possibility that well see that same Immunosuppression on a moon base And so my concern is we havent really done all our homework in finding out why the Tcells are not being activated and of course on the moon theres a lot of moon dust and during Apollo they found that the moon dust would get in the air it got all over them
    - So we would have to control the dust for one thing you dont want the dust in the air and people breathing it in that might have bacteria attached to it the other thing is the moon dust is very sharp actually on some of the suits that came back from the Apollo astronauts they were worn because it was more like an abrasive and anyplace they would have movement it would just saw into the fabric
    - And so you dont want people breathing that in
    - Miller So what measures are being taken as plans take shape for this moon base
    - HughesFulford Well hopefully by now theyre putting in a lot of filters and a lot of fans to keep the dust down I havent seen the plans lately in the beginning I know they werent really considering how to maintain it but I think they are beginning to think about it now
    - Miller And with the immunosuppression the risk then is if someone gets sick then everybody gets sick
    - HughesFulford Its in the air right
    - Miller and that could devastate the whole group of people who are studying and living and working there
    - HughesFulford I think that we just need to do our homework find out A how much gravity do you need for your Tcell to normally activate I dont know We havent done the work How do you keep the moon dust off of things because it has some static electrical properties that tends to cling to people Theres a picture of one of the Apollo astronauts that looks like hes got black on his face its moon dust So I think its real important we start looking at these things and do our homework before we get there
    - Miller I could envision what an exercise space on a moon base might look like as a gravity countermeasure but when we talk about a longer space flight like to the planet Mars how does that work
    - HughesFulford I think all of us have seen the movies with the spacecrafts with rotating centrifuges inside like I think thats the best way to do it create an artificial gravity So far I havent seen any space vehicles being designed that had that built into them
    - Miller For reasons of cost or for other reasons
    - HughesFulford Oh it takes a lot of energy if you have a centrifuge going one direction its kind of like a top itll be going in another direction youre causing a force to get off orbit so you need two of them going in opposite directions to stay in your flight path So that cost money to run but again the question is do you need it hours or do you just need an hour of it a day to keep everything normal
    - Miller And we dont have the answers to that question yet
    - HughesFulford I dont know No one knows So I think doing a little bit of homework might save us a lot of money
    - HughesFulford Oh Im a big fan of the robotics guys JPL big fan We need robotics We need to go We need to find more about Mars do we have water on Mars its going to make it a lot easier to live on Mars So I think we really need robotics to do our homework with
    - And then I think we need to go into space but I think we need better propulsion were still using the same oldfashioned propulsion they were using in World War II
    - Miller The technologys not improved at all since then
    - HughesFulford I dont think its changed a bit
    - Miller We dont have any bright young engineering students studying propulsion
    - HughesFulford Well you would have to have a program to help support them People have to eat and they have to have a place to sleep You can have great ideas but you still have to live And unless we have programs to promote new thoughts and to take us into new areas its not going to happen
    - Miller And youre saying these programs dont exist
    - HughesFulford I havent seen a lot of them I would like to see engineering schools get grants to do forward thinking and then pick the best ideas and then fund them I do know there is a plasma drive being worked on in Costa Rica
    - Miller In Costa Rica by whom
    - HughesFulford I think its Chang Diaz a former astronaut who is working on it And I think theyre making some progress on it and a plasma drive would only take about a month to get to Mars instead of nine months so that would reduce the amount of radiation exposure reduce the amount of damage from not being in a gravity field itd be much better
    - Miller Is it realistic for us to assume that were going to inhabit other planets Thats a little out of your field I realize but youve been an astronaut so lets speculate

    - But yes I dont see any reason that by we would be doing that Theres probably a warp drive engineer out there a young kid or one yet to be born Yes absolutely
    - Miller Fair enough Early in the space program on one of its enduring facets was this spinoff s into consumer culture and other things Since youre in the field of health Im wondering these things youre learning are their going to be more benefits for more earthbound needs

    title: "Translating Science: A Conversation with Pioneering Fetal Surgeon Michael Harrison"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Michael Harrison
    - Young children sometimes play games in parallel worlds even when occupying the same space
    - The same can sometimes be true of science and medicine Doctors and researchers might speak the same language and perhaps use some of the same tools but their different accents think brain surgeon and a protein structure expert signal different origins and often a different perspective on the big questions of human health
    - In short they need a translator
    - This becomes obvious when an elegant scientific discovery or a searing insight fuses into a medical marvel Only then do we truly hear the music of the spheres as Pythagoras would say and understand the underlying harmony behind it
    - UCSFs Michael Harrison MD professor of surgery pediatrics and obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences and director of the Fetal Treatment Center first made music for the world nearly years ago Filled with the indignation of a young doctor at the death of an infant he challenged conventional wisdom by suggesting testing and then performing with his colleagues the worlds first open fetal surgery
    - In the decades since Harrison has studied and devised remedies for a number of lifethreatening fetal abnormalities With each advance the surgeries have become less and less invasive And in keeping with the spirit of the times he and his colleagues have also used stem cell transplants to treat a number of immune and enzyme deficiencies
    - Even now his work which he describes as both science and art still excites and entices him And in the conversation that follows he remains as optimistic about the future as ever

    - Michael Harrison The first surgeries were rather invasive You opened the mom perhaps open the uterus do something to the fetus close the uterus close the mom And then over the last three decades we advanced in the same way that many fields have advanced to less and less and less invasive techniques So we went through the stage of converting our open surgeries to fetoscopic surgeries where you didnt necessarily have to open the uterus you could put a little telescope inside and work with little tiny instruments We actually developed a whole series of techniques which in aggregate we called fetendo
    - Jeff Miller Fetendo
    - Harrison Exactly And the reason is we did it in the late searly s when all our kids were playing Nintendo and its pretty much that same kind of thing Youre looking at a screen with an image projected on the screen from your telescope which is inside the uterus looking at the fetus or sometimes its inside the fetus looking at the inside of the fetus on one screen and on a screen right next to it youre looking at a cross sectional image of the fetal part youre working on and thats done with sonograms
    - It was quite revolutionary at the time to use two modalities simultaneously side by side in real time One a visual image through an endoscope and the other a cross sectional sonographic image
    - Miller Has your willingness to tackle certain problems that arise in utero changed with the technology
    - Harrison Oh very much so Because with the old technology there was considerable morbidity and some risk to the mother So we couldnt justify doing anything except in extremely serious and in fact life threatening conditions in the fetus
    - Now as you get less and less invasive and less and less risk and safer and safer we can start thinking about doing things that arent necessarily lifethreatening but are still very serious problems in the fetus We can take on other problems
    - Miller Some examples
    - Harrison A good example is mylomalngmacil Mylomalngmacil is the first non life threatening problem we took on But of course its a very serious problem I like to think of it as a life ruining problem certainly limiting problem and certainly worth our efforts to fix it But the techniques had to be safe enough to justify going after that
    - Another one might be stem cell transplantation or any cellular therapies or tissue engineering which is you can do it through a needle through a very tiny telescope if you can deliver the cells if you can deliver the genes its certainly worth it because its quite safe It wouldnt be worth it if it required a big operation
    - Miller And how many surgeries like this are performed at UCSF every year now
    - Harrison Well the total number of fetal procedures grows every year its quite an active and good field But the striking shift is the open fetal surgeries the BIG fetal surgeries are becoming less and less of course as we replace them with less invasive procedures So the big open fetal surgeries from the past are down to a halfdozen a year or less and its going to be less and less we hope
    - Miller And the number of the other kind
    - Harrison And the number of the other procedures is rising so that theyre probably one a week SOME kind of intervention
    - Miller Well Im curious since you pioneered this field as you talk about these less invasive methods were the actual techniques and the technology required the result of you driving the creation of those implements and instruments Because you said you needed itif we had something designed like this we could do it this way and therefore be less invasive or was it an adoption and adaptation of something that already existed
    - Harrison No no we had to make em up from scratch But the way I think about it is not so much that I drove the development its that the patients drove the development because they had problems that needed to be solved and we just had to struggle in how to solve them In many cases it meant making things up from absolute scratch Instruments and just a myriad of little steps
    - And the actual carrying out of that essentially continuous innovation is really more attributable to our bright young people than it is to the old guys like me because theyre constantly back here in the lab solving problems And weve been exceedingly fortunate to have very talented people as research fellows in the laboratory whove really powered this
    - Miller So this is a science and an art
    - Harrison For sure
    - Miller The numbers of people who are practicing fetal procedures around the world right now what would you guess would be the percentage of those who have trained at UCSF or at least passed through on some kind of fellowship or whatever
    - Harrison The way it worked out is the whole fetal enterprise was essentially founded here and then a few very good colleagues around the world joined us and it was only a few centers that did it Then the young people started coming through our program went out into the world and essentially populated all real fetal centers certainly in the US and a little in Canada and sometimes overseas and ran them Very quickly though they had their own colleagues and their own young people and theyre wonderful And certainly the Europeans have just taken off and done a great job So its proliferated in the way that it should
    - I dont know how to answer the question of how many of the people all over the world doing fetal intervention are from here its not that many anymore only because of this geometric proliferation But the ones who started it in almost every center came from here
    - Miller How have the patients changed if at allare they more knowledgeable when they come
    - Harrison Theres a very interesting answer to that it has to do with the internet In the old days it was the old system the only way patients would learn that something was available or that someone was doing something interesting was they went to their doctor and their doctor might happen to have heard of a journal article or heard a talk in a meeting or something Thats pretty hit and miss in most cases miss They dont ever find out about us
    - Now its totally changed and weve been instrumental in this because weve developed a webpage specifically aimed at educating patients When their doctor says oh we looked at your fetus and he or she has x disease they jump on the internet Google it and see where they go
    - Well in most cases now they come to our UCSF fetal treatment website because its really good Its really informative its really helpful to families So thats a HUGE difference And by the way that also saves billions of phone calls and sending sonograms back and forth and all that But theres a followup to that that is even more interesting
    - We work very hard on taking our webpage which is informational to pregnant moms and converting it to a web portal in which we interact with the families through the internet And that has been wonderful We actually have online patients now And they interact with us through a secret portal just as if they were here And it saves them the trip to San Francisco in many cases
    - Miller So this is just a way for them to transmit information about their particular child or and then for you to speak to the doctor as well
    - Harrison Thats a very interesting question because they usually go to their doctor of course and they find out what the problem is and then they get to our webpage and through our page they say oh we would like to get another opinion and you manage this thing essentially over the web
    - And then we have a relationship with them which is a very professionally protected relationshipthey send us sonograms they have a calendar we have a calendar we see them on the web they see us on the web and in that of course is their doctor But the nest phase of it which were just developing now is a threeway relationship in which the patient and the doctor interact with us through this portal
    - Miller Im going to ask you to speculate a little bit now when you think about the future what might be the role of stem cells in all of this
    - Harrison Theres an interesting answer from the past for this Before people got interested in stem cells that is in the late s early s we were very very enthusiastic about doing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in fetuses And actually studied it like crazy in fetal monkeys and even did some very initial human work And the general idea here was to take hematopoietic the easiest kind of stem cell and essentially do a bone marrow transplant in utero taking advantage of the fetus privileged position with the hope that we could cure a number of diseases that would require bone marrow transplantation after birth Like sickle cell disease hemaglobinopathies immunodeficiencies it would really be wonderful
    - We and many others did a great deal of work on this but we never really cracked the nut It will be cracked and folks are still working on it were still working on it it will happen and its going to be wonderful but we havent really solved the problem of getting sufficient ingraftment in fetuses
    - It will happen theres a great future for it
    - Miller Any other future for stem cells do you suppose
    - Harrison Well that business of working with hematopoietic stem cells does not actually get us into the controversial aspect of embryonic stem cells that is the source of the stem cell you are going to use to cure the fetus was not much of a problem because hematopoietic stem cells are easy to harvest from the mother or the dad so that was a nice aspect of it
    - In the future and with all the wonderful sciences happening around stem cells now and once the controversys overcomewhich I think it will beI personally think that the biggest application the best chance for really having an effect on a persons life is transplantation in utero
    - That is however you get the stem cells the place to cure those diseases is before birth for a couple reasons
    - Number one Its going to be easier from an immunological point of view Number two many of the terrible diseases that we would target actually do damage before youre born so you better get there early The third aspect of that is because weve been working on it so long that general idea of access to the fetus has become so much better safer and we can do it so much earlier that its really going to make it feasible
    - Miller Last question Why did all this take place at UCSFbecause of you
    - Harrison Its a good environment for this the enterprise is so difficult I hate to say it but its so difficult from all kinds of points of view from clinical technical ethical that you need an incredibly supportive environment to push forward Youll always beyou just cant make progress without that environment
    - And by supportive I mean some folks who dont like the enterprise who are willing to criticize you correctly and who are willing to question the enterprise but in the end will be reasonable about the scientific validity of it
    - And there arent many places that have that environment and we certainly do here

    - Michael Harrison
    - Young children sometimes play games in parallel worlds even when occupying the same space
    - The same can sometimes be true of science and medicine Doctors and researchers might speak the same language and perhaps use some of the same tools but their different accents think brain surgeon and a protein structure expert signal different origins and often a different perspective on the big questions of human health
    - In short they need a translator
    - This becomes obvious when an elegant scientific discovery or a searing insight fuses into a medical marvel Only then do we truly hear the music of the spheres as Pythagoras would say and understand the underlying harmony behind it
    - UCSFs Michael Harrison MD professor of surgery pediatrics and obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences and director of the Fetal Treatment Center first made music for the world nearly years ago Filled with the indignation of a young doctor at the death of an infant he challenged conventional wisdom by suggesting testing and then performing with his colleagues the worlds first open fetal surgery
    - In the decades since Harrison has studied and devised remedies for a number of lifethreatening fetal abnormalities With each advance the surgeries have become less and less invasive And in keeping with the spirit of the times he and his colleagues have also used stem cell transplants to treat a number of immune and enzyme deficiencies
    - Even now his work which he describes as both science and art still excites and entices him And in the conversation that follows he remains as optimistic about the future as ever

    - Michael Harrison The first surgeries were rather invasive You opened the mom perhaps open the uterus do something to the fetus close the uterus close the mom And then over the last three decades we advanced in the same way that many fields have advanced to less and less and less invasive techniques So we went through the stage of converting our open surgeries to fetoscopic surgeries where you didnt necessarily have to open the uterus you could put a little telescope inside and work with little tiny instruments We actually developed a whole series of techniques which in aggregate we called fetendo
    - Jeff Miller Fetendo
    - Harrison Exactly And the reason is we did it in the late searly s when all our kids were playing Nintendo and its pretty much that same kind of thing Youre looking at a screen with an image projected on the screen from your telescope which is inside the uterus looking at the fetus or sometimes its inside the fetus looking at the inside of the fetus on one screen and on a screen right next to it youre looking at a cross sectional image of the fetal part youre working on and thats done with sonograms
    - It was quite revolutionary at the time to use two modalities simultaneously side by side in real time One a visual image through an endoscope and the other a cross sectional sonographic image
    - Miller Has your willingness to tackle certain problems that arise in utero changed with the technology
    - Harrison Oh very much so Because with the old technology there was considerable morbidity and some risk to the mother So we couldnt justify doing anything except in extremely serious and in fact life threatening conditions in the fetus
    - Now as you get less and less invasive and less and less risk and safer and safer we can start thinking about doing things that arent necessarily lifethreatening but are still very serious problems in the fetus We can take on other problems
    - Miller Some examples
    - Harrison A good example is mylomalngmacil Mylomalngmacil is the first non life threatening problem we took on But of course its a very serious problem I like to think of it as a life ruining problem certainly limiting problem and certainly worth our efforts to fix it But the techniques had to be safe enough to justify going after that
    - Another one might be stem cell transplantation or any cellular therapies or tissue engineering which is you can do it through a needle through a very tiny telescope if you can deliver the cells if you can deliver the genes its certainly worth it because its quite safe It wouldnt be worth it if it required a big operation
    - Miller And how many surgeries like this are performed at UCSF every year now
    - Harrison Well the total number of fetal procedures grows every year its quite an active and good field But the striking shift is the open fetal surgeries the BIG fetal surgeries are becoming less and less of course as we replace them with less invasive procedures So the big open fetal surgeries from the past are down to a halfdozen a year or less and its going to be less and less we hope
    - Miller And the number of the other kind
    - Harrison And the number of the other procedures is rising so that theyre probably one a week SOME kind of intervention
    - Miller Well Im curious since you pioneered this field as you talk about these less invasive methods were the actual techniques and the technology required the result of you driving the creation of those implements and instruments Because you said you needed itif we had something designed like this we could do it this way and therefore be less invasive or was it an adoption and adaptation of something that already existed
    - Harrison No no we had to make em up from scratch But the way I think about it is not so much that I drove the development its that the patients drove the development because they had problems that needed to be solved and we just had to struggle in how to solve them In many cases it meant making things up from absolute scratch Instruments and just a myriad of little steps
    - And the actual carrying out of that essentially continuous innovation is really more attributable to our bright young people than it is to the old guys like me because theyre constantly back here in the lab solving problems And weve been exceedingly fortunate to have very talented people as research fellows in the laboratory whove really powered this
    - Miller So this is a science and an art
    - Harrison For sure
    - Miller The numbers of people who are practicing fetal procedures around the world right now what would you guess would be the percentage of those who have trained at UCSF or at least passed through on some kind of fellowship or whatever

    title: "Mysteries of the Heart: A Conversation with Cardiologist and Researcher Robin Shaw"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - When it comes to understanding the human heart we think were pretty smart
    - We know that the heart is basically a pump for what is literally our lifeblood When the arteries carrying this blood clog up with residue they can be cleaned out or repaired or portions of them can be bypassed surgically
    - Or we can swallow drugs that minimize the risk of clogs
    - Whatever the method the perspective is clear Artery health is heart health
    - UCSFs Robin Shaw MD PhD says well not exactly From his perspective as both a doctor and a laboratory scientist it is the heart cells themselves that should command at least equal attention For starters we dont even know how many heart cells there are It could be millions It could be a billion They assemble early in gestation and organize themselves into a complex densely packed urban environment with elaborate communication networks
    - Robin Shaw
    - Why Heart cells must contract in an orderly fashion or were in trouble They also must be able to react to changing circumstances like aerobic exercise for example Or danger In short they need to be steady and supple and to work in concert Communication is essential
    - Shaw studies this communication network specifically ion channels and what are called gap junctions between heart cells These junctions are the bridges over which signals flow
    - To his surprise his research has now revealed that these bridges disappear in a sequential manner every hour Its a mystery but one Shaw relishes hes a big fan of spy novels and one that could someday redefine what heart failure really means

    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im here with Robin Shaw assistant professor of medicine in the department of cardiology at UCSF and also an investigator at the Cardiovascular research Institute Welcome Robin
    - Shaw Thank you very much
    - Miller I noticed youre an MDPhD and as people who regularly listen to these podcasts understands you are in a class of people I truly admire I wonder how long did it take you to acquire both degrees
    - Shaw Well to save myself the math Im right now Ive been on the clinical faculty for four years now and Ive been an independent investigator for one year
    - Miller So a lot of time studying and learning was all that time worth it
    - Shaw Absolutely
    - Miller Why do you say that
    - Shaw Theres a lot of time involved in the training but the training essentially is the career Its a career of investigation And Ive been involved in investigation since my early twenties
    - Miller So Im sure youre aware that there is a decline in the number of MVPhDs at least in the US is that something you think about of worry about or discussed as you were acquiring both degrees
    - Shaw Absolutely The landscape has changed write a bit since I started training I entered medical school in so roughly years ago Two generations ago it was sufficient for a doctor to do science however the practice of medicine has become so much more technical that the training of physicians is more clinically oriented than it used to be and whats lost there is the basic science background for physicians At the same time science has made remarkable advances in the past several decades and so the training of science has left behind the general physiology let alone path of physiology from which we derive a lot of our basic questions And so theres been a polarization between science and medicine And guys like myself MDPhDs try to fill that void
    - Miller Do you feel sometimes youre not welcome in either camp I know youre early in your career but I wonder
    - Shaw It is tough because ultimately for real practical reasons its good to have a home in an institution and increasingly the clinical home is not a shelter for scientists and a scientific home is not a shelter for clinicians And so we end up really one foot in each And again for very practical reasons its tough to exist in both worlds
    - Miller Well speaking of other worlds I know that you were born in South Africa Did you come from a family of scientists or medical people
    - Shaw My uncle and my aunt are physicians my father is a veterinarian and my grandfather a pharmacist
    - Miller Did you say you wanted to be a doctor when you were growing up
    - Shaw No never
    - Miller What was your first career aspiration
    - Shaw I was headed along the computer science engineering route
    - Miller What made you switch
    - Shaw It was late in college I started to get involved in research I quite enjoyed research but I found the questions I could as an engineer were not as exciting as the questions I could as a biologist
    - Miller And where were you going to college at the time
    - Shaw Brown University
    - Miller When did you come to the US
    - Shaw I grew up in Florida I was really only years old when I came from South Africa
    - Miller Oddball question but Im curious Do you have time to read novels or books that are about science or mysteries do you have a particular gene that you like
    - Shaw Its a great question and frankly no My time at home is spent on ageappropriate books for a yearold and a yearold and a toddler Although my interest in reading at least in the past was spy novels Thats my secret little pleasure
    - Miller So you like the term investigator I guess the CVRI
    - Shaw I suppose so
    - Miller OK Ion channel regulation I know thats the focus of your research but before we really get into the details of that Im curious if there are any common misconceptions the average person might have about the heart the role of the heart how it functions that you see or you hear or learn about in your interactions with patients or with others
    - Shaw I think we all understand the heart to be a complicated organ but one misperception that I try to change is that the heart has many different gradations of working Its not as if the heart stops working or works well And the reason for that is that the heart when you break it down to its elements is composed of millions of individual cells
    - Miller So how many millions
    - Shaw Somewhere between a million and a billion
    - Miller No precise number
    - Shaw laughter No I would guess roughly million cells
    - Miller And these are largely cells that were born with in the infant heart correct
    - Shaw Thats correct once were born we generate very few new cells
    - Miller So the cells increase in size but not in number
    - Shaw Exactly
    - Miller So you mentioned the fact that people think of the heart as working or not working but there are many gradations What would be an example of something thats percentage function that they dont understand
    - Shaw When the heart pumps it can eject blood at its peak efficiency which is about of the blood with each squeeze of the main pumping chamber or it can inject of the blood with each squeeze of the main pumping chamber
    - Miller There must have been something about heart function that attracted you in your research pursuits and there must have been a lot of avenues you couldve chosen so why this field
    - Shaw There is something fundamental about the heart It has to work every second for us to live When it stops functioning we dont have blood flow and unless its restarted we die And so that fundamental aspect of the heart as a requirement for our existence which is such a delicate balance that was the attraction
    - Miller Sudden cardiac death something we hear about often when its a young athlete who dies in the practice field or soon after a contest how does that condition relate to the work you do
    - Shaw Sudden cardiac death is a misunderstood concept The technical definition of sudden cardiac death is the heart stopping That does not mean the heart cant be restarted And so when someone experiences sudden cardiac death the heart no longer works as a pump hence theres no blood flow Now many of us are familiar with defibrillation when people get shocks either by an implantable defibrillator or the pedals on the chest that weve all seen on TV The reason defibrillation works say after a heart attack is that the rhythm of the heart is restored So going back to the millions of individual heart cells these heart cells need to work in synchrony for the heart to work as an organ for it to beat as a pump
    - When there is sudden cardiac death the synchronicity of cells no longer exists so the individual cells might be contracting but they dont contract in coordination and therefore the heart as a pump doesnt work When we apply electricity we reset the synchrony So for example in a heart attack a small part of the heart is actually damaged however that small part of the heart can set off a generalized electrical disturbance to ruin the synchrony When we shock the small part of the heart is still not working but the synchrony of most of the muscle is restored
    - Sudden cardiac death really is an electrical issue its an issue of synchrony of the heart and its fatal unless reversed
    - Miller So how does the ion channel regulation of this process relate to that description you just gave
    - Shaw The electrical system of the heart coordinates the mechanical system So the heart has a timer if you will like a Quartz crystal the old watches every second sets off a signal hey contract and that signal passes throughout these millions of cells which in each individual cell causes a contraction and when that contraction happens together the heart works as a pump
    - Its the ion channels that carry these signals to contract throughout these millions of cells So every second ion channels are telling each individual heart cell to contract and telling the next cell their neighbor hey were going to contract and you better contract as well
    - Miller So this is the communication system among all the cells
    - Shaw Thats right So there are ion channels that exist not only for individual cell but between each cell These ion channels are known as gap junctions
    - Miller So were not talking a river way channel but a communications system and pathway
    - Shaw Thats just it I think of it as a passageway But a highly regulated passageway
    - Miller What exactly do you study about these ion channels and what tools and techniques do you use
    - Shaw What I study is how these ion channels these regulations of the electricity of the heart are formed how they get where they need to go and how this process is affected by a blocked artery
    - Let me give you a metaphor An individual heart is cell is roughly the width of an individual hair Thats about to a hundred microns across And Think of that individual heart cell as being a city One heart cell is San Francisco and the other is Oakland Between SF and Oakland is the Bay Bridge the Bay Bridge is essential for the Bay Area to function as a whole
    - Now to carry that metaphor the Bay Bridge is our gap junction our communication between our two cities or in the case of the gap junction between the two heart cells However gap junctions are removed every hour And so going back to our metaphor its as if the Bay Bridge disappeared every hour
    - pMiller Why is that
    - Shaw We dont know Thats relatively recent knowledge We used to think these channels were so important that they were there forever They disappear and now ones replace it
    - Miller Every hour
    - Shaw Every hour
    - Miller What do you suppose is the evolutionary reason for that I wonder
    - Shaw Its a fascinating question And it speaks to the dynamic nature of the individual cells in the heart and how they probably have to respond to stress And so when say the heart gets an extra stimulus or the heart gets an insult how does it overcome those environmental factors because again the heart needs to beat for the organism to live
    - How is it that the heart can respond so dynamically to many different kinds of stress
    - Miller But doesnt an hour seem like a long time
    - Shaw The overall turnover rate is an hour so thats where honestly the metaphor does fall apart because its not just one Bay Bridge there are many thousands of small bridges that the overall turnover rate for each individual one lasts about an hour
    - Miller So were not without bridges completely theres one disappearing but eh system continues and the one at the back
    - Shaw And thats exactly what we study How is it that on average there is always the same bridges How is it that theres always communication between SF and Oakland How is it in the heart that theres always communication between the heart cells Despite the fact that its so dynamic
    - Miller So what do you think
    - Shaw And so what exists in individual heart cells are highways call it the cyber skeleton Which helps set up the structure of the cells but what were learning is these structural elements of the cells are not just there for structure but there to bring channels to where they need to go And so theyre not just structural components but theyre transport components of the cell And this system breaks down when an arterys blocked
    - And so just to tie it into an earlier question of yours how does sudden cardiac death occur It occurs when a blocked artery causes the heart cells to stop generating these proteins to block these proteins These proteins which are channels dont go where they need to go That causes a decrease in communication between the cells which sets off an arrhythmia which upsets to coordination of the heart
    - Miller So looking at it from the individual point of view what can a person do when we talk about measures they can take to heart health Does this information at all inform prevention methods that people can employ to maintain their own heart health
    - Shaw Thats a good question The best of our knowledge today addresses not so much the muscle of the heart but the arteries that feed the heart And what Im talking about is cholesterol Atherosclerosis coronary artery disease How do we prevent blockages from developing in our arteries
    - In time what I hope this research will lead to is a new kind of therapy for the heart If we accept that were going to have coronary heart disease and were not going to wipe it out there are millions of Americans walking around with damaged hearts who would love to restore health to their damaged hearts and one of the ways we hope to do that is by improving the way the individual heart cells function And by learning more about the biology of the heart cells learning more about how they regulate the proteins which are essential for their function we hope to understand how to improve function when compromised by blocked arteries
    - Miller So this is where the fusion of the MDPhD comes into play you have a unique perspective on this problem
    - Shaw Perhaps not unique but at least informed I do both clinical care and basic science research If you walk into my laboratory its a basic science laboratory no different than any other scientists laboratory at the University The difference if you will in our approach is that the clinical insight informs the questions were asking in the laboratory
    - Miller Is there a specific example other than the more general one on ion channel regulation something that maybe was a question triggered in your mind by a patient that you treated
    - Shaw Absolutely I take care of a lot of patients who have heart failure by definition thats decreased pumping of the heart Most of these patients have suffered damage to the heart as a result of blocked arteries however a good subset of these patients have decreased pump function who have no more arteries And the question is why
    - We term this kind of heart failure idiopathic cardiomyopathy and I like to joke that when we as clinicians call something idiopathic its because we feel like idiots We dont know what causes it
    - Miller Can you give me a percentage
    - Shaw It would be to ten percent of heart failure patients and that depends with age group
    - Miller So the kind of work youre now doing might help to explain this mystery
    - Shaw Absolutely The reason I raise that example is that the basis of heart failure is that the cells dont work well with each other And the individual cells dont work well enough
    - And thats a long ways away from how we traditionally thought about heart failure which is well blocked arteries dont give enough blood supply to the heart therefore if we improve the blood supply the hearts going to come back to its normal function What Im focusing on is not so much the insult but the actual heart cells themselveShaw what causes them to be damaged what is this process of damage at a sub cellular level and when we understand that we can understand how to improve how the individual cells work
    - Miller Clearly this must have implications for congestive heart failure patients as well of which there are millions I believe in the US
    - Shaw There are at least million patients in the US who have heart failure there are halfamillion new heart failure patients that are added to that number per year in the US theres a growing epidemic Part of that is good news
    - Miller How so
    - Shaw laughter Sorry I should explain When patients suffer heart attacks as a result of what we do in the Cath lab as a result of bypass surgery as a result of stents more patients survive their heart attacks But as a result they do suffer heart damage they do suffer heart failure
    - Miller So part of this increase in number is a result of successful other procedures but they do consequences
    - Shaw Thats exactly it So for good reasons and bad heart failure is an increasing health problem in the US
    - Miller You mentioned earlier about a new type of therapeutic medications describe to me how that might actually work
    - Shaw This would be in the form of a drug and when I think about the heart Im thinking about individual cells and when I think about individual cells I dont think about them as amorphous single units Im thinking about them as complex cities going back to that SF and Oakland analogy And so what drugs are out there that can improve the way transportation works in this city And what I mean about transportation I mean how proteins are moved around in the cell To go where they need to go To not go where they shouldnt go And the more we understand of the biology of how these cells work we will therefore be able to use drugs that affect these processes
    - Miller I cant let you go without asking about the potential of stem cells in your work Do you foresee any benefits
    - Shaw Stem cells are obviously a very exciting topic and our investigators are hot on the trail Where the work I do fits into stem cell therapy is that any cells that are injected into the heart will need to communicate with the rest of the heart For example one of the earliest forms of stem cell therapy in humans was taking skeletal muscle precursor cells and injecting them into the heart to improve the hearts ability to contract And what happened from earlier trials that occurred in France is that patients died from arrhythmias and the reason was the cells that were injected did not communicate they may work individually as muscle cells but they couldnt work in concert with thee rest of the heart
    - It was shown as recently as a few months ago in a very exciting study if the skeletal muscle cells are modified to include these communication proteins these gap junctions we were talking about earlier the arrhythmias can be resolved
    - So where my work comes in is how the cells injected into the heart communicate with the rest of the myocardium And thats going to be I think a very exciting area of research in the next decade
    - Miller Robin thank you for that glimpse into the future and thanks for joining me on Science Caf
    - Shaw Thank you Jeff

    title: "Mysteries of the Heart: A Conversation with Cardiologist and Researcher Robin Shaw"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - When it comes to understanding the human heart we think were pretty smart
    - We know that the heart is basically a pump for what is literally our lifeblood When the arteries carrying this blood clog up with residue they can be cleaned out or repaired or portions of them can be bypassed surgically
    - Or we can swallow drugs that minimize the risk of clogs
    - Whatever the method the perspective is clear Artery health is heart health
    - UCSFs Robin Shaw MD PhD says well not exactly From his perspective as both a doctor and a laboratory scientist it is the heart cells themselves that should command at least equal attention For starters we dont even know how many heart cells there are It could be millions It could be a billion They assemble early in gestation and organize themselves into a complex densely packed urban environment with elaborate communication networks
    - Robin Shaw
    - Why Heart cells must contract in an orderly fashion or were in trouble They also must be able to react to changing circumstances like aerobic exercise for example Or danger In short they need to be steady and supple and to work in concert Communication is essential
    - Shaw studies this communication network specifically ion channels and what are called gap junctions between heart cells These junctions are the bridges over which signals flow
    - To his surprise his research has now revealed that these bridges disappear in a sequential manner every hour Its a mystery but one Shaw relishes hes a big fan of spy novels and one that could someday redefine what heart failure really means

    - Podcast transcript
    - Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im here with Robin Shaw assistant professor of medicine in the department of cardiology at UCSF and also an investigator at the Cardiovascular research Institute Welcome Robin
    - Shaw Thank you very much
    - Miller I noticed youre an MDPhD and as people who regularly listen to these podcasts understands you are in a class of people I truly admire I wonder how long did it take you to acquire both degrees
    - Shaw Well to save myself the math Im right now Ive been on the clinical faculty for four years now and Ive been an independent investigator for one year
    - Miller So a lot of time studying and learning was all that time worth it
    - Shaw Absolutely
    - Miller Why do you say that
    - Shaw Theres a lot of time involved in the training but the training essentially is the career Its a career of investigation And Ive been involved in investigation since my early twenties
    - Miller So Im sure youre aware that there is a decline in the number of MVPhDs at least in the US is that something you think about of worry about or discussed as you were acquiring both degrees
    - Shaw Absolutely The landscape has changed write a bit since I started training I entered medical school in so roughly years ago Two generations ago it was sufficient for a doctor to do science however the practice of medicine has become so much more technical that the training of physicians is more clinically oriented than it used to be and whats lost there is the basic science background for physicians At the same time science has made remarkable advances in the past several decades and so the training of science has left behind the general physiology let alone path of physiology from which we derive a lot of our basic questions And so theres been a polarization between science and medicine And guys like myself MDPhDs try to fill that void
    - Miller Do you feel sometimes youre not welcome in either camp I know youre early in your career but I wonder
    - Shaw It is tough because ultimately for real practical reasons its good to have a home in an institution and increasingly the clinical home is not a shelter for scientists and a scientific home is not a shelter for clinicians And so we end up really one foot in each And again for very practical reasons its tough to exist in both worlds
    - Miller Well speaking of other worlds I know that you were born in South Africa Did you come from a family of scientists or medical people
    - Shaw My uncle and my aunt are physicians my father is a veterinarian and my grandfather a pharmacist
    - Miller Did you say you wanted to be a doctor when you were growing up
    - Shaw No never
    - Miller What was your first career aspiration
    - Shaw I was headed along the computer science engineering route
    - Miller What made you switch
    - Shaw It was late in college I started to get involved in research I quite enjoyed research but I found the questions I could as an engineer were not as exciting as the questions I could as a biologist
    - Miller And where were you going to college at the time
    - Shaw Brown University
    - Miller When did you come to the US
    - Shaw I grew up in Florida I was really only years old when I came from South Africa
    - Miller Oddball question but Im curious Do you have time to read novels or books that are about science or mysteries do you have a particular gene that you like
    - Shaw Its a great question and frankly no My time at home is spent on ageappropriate books for a yearold and a yearold and a toddler Although my interest in reading at least in the past was spy novels Thats my secret little pleasure
    - Miller So you like the term investigator I guess the CVRI
    - Shaw I suppose so
    - Miller OK Ion channel regulation I know thats the focus of your research but before we really get into the details of that Im curious if there are any common misconceptions the average person might have about the heart the role of the heart how it functions that you see or you hear or learn about in your interactions with patients or with others
    - Shaw I think we all understand the heart to be a complicated organ but one misperception that I try to change is that the heart has many different gradations of working Its not as if the heart stops working or works well And the reason for that is that the heart when you break it down to its elements is composed of millions of individual cells
    - Miller So how many millions
    - Shaw Somewhere between a million and a billion
    - Miller No precise number
    - Shaw laughter No I would guess roughly million cells
    - Miller And these are largely cells that were born with in the infant heart correct
    - Shaw Thats correct once were born we generate very few new cells
    - Miller So the cells increase in size but not in number
    - Shaw Exactly
    - Miller So you mentioned the fact that people think of the heart as working or not working but there are many gradations What would be an example of something thats percentage function that they dont understand
    - Shaw When the heart pumps it can eject blood at its peak efficiency which is about of the blood with each squeeze of the main pumping chamber or it can inject of the blood with each squeeze of the main pumping chamber
    - Miller There must have been something about heart function that attracted you in your research pursuits and there must have been a lot of avenues you couldve chosen so why this field
    - Shaw There is something fundamental about the heart It has to work every second for us to live When it stops functioning we dont have blood flow and unless its restarted we die And so that fundamental aspect of the heart as a requirement for our existence which is such a delicate balance that was the attraction
    - Miller Sudden cardiac death something we hear about often when its a young athlete who dies in the practice field or soon after a contest how does that condition relate to the work you do
    - Shaw Sudden cardiac death is a misunderstood concept The technical definition of sudden cardiac death is the heart stopping That does not mean the heart cant be restarted And so when someone experiences sudden cardiac death the heart no longer works as a pump hence theres no blood flow Now many of us are familiar with defibrillation when people get shocks either by an implantable defibrillator or the pedals on the chest that weve all seen on TV The reason defibrillation works say after a heart attack is that the rhythm of the heart is restored So going back to the millions of individual heart cells these heart cells need to work in synchrony for the heart to work as an organ for it to beat as a pump
    - When there is sudden cardiac death the synchronicity of cells no longer exists so the individual cells might be contracting but they dont contract in coordination and therefore the heart as a pump doesnt work When we apply electricity we reset the synchrony So for example in a heart attack a small part of the heart is actually damaged however that small part of the heart can set off a generalized electrical disturbance to ruin the synchrony When we shock the small part of the heart is still not working but the synchrony of most of the muscle is restored
    - Sudden cardiac death really is an electrical issue its an issue of synchrony of the heart and its fatal unless reversed
    - Miller So how does the ion channel regulation of this process relate to that description you just gave
    - Shaw The electrical system of the heart coordinates the mechanical system So the heart has a timer if you will like a Quartz crystal the old watches every second sets off a signal hey contract and that signal passes throughout these millions of cells which in each individual cell causes a contraction and when that contraction happens together the heart works as a pump
    - Its the ion channels that carry these signals to contract throughout these millions of cells So every second ion channels are telling each individual heart cell to contract and telling the next cell their neighbor hey were going to contract and you better contract as well
    - Miller So this is the communication system among all the cells
    - Shaw Thats right So there are ion channels that exist not only for individual cell but between each cell These ion channels are known as gap junctions
    - Miller So were not talking a river way channel but a communications system and pathway
    - Shaw Thats just it I think of it as a passageway But a highly regulated passageway
    - Miller What exactly do you study about these ion channels and what tools and techniques do you use
    - Shaw What I study is how these ion channels these regulations of the electricity of the heart are formed how they get where they need to go and how this process is affected by a blocked artery
    - Let me give you a metaphor An individual heart is cell is roughly the width of an individual hair Thats about to a hundred microns across And Think of that individual heart cell as being a city One heart cell is San Francisco and the other is Oakland Between SF and Oakland is the Bay Bridge the Bay Bridge is essential for the Bay Area to function as a whole
    - Now to carry that metaphor the Bay Bridge is our gap junction our communication between our two cities or in the case of the gap junction between the two heart cells However gap junctions are removed every hour And so going back to our metaphor its as if the Bay Bridge disappeared every hour
    - Miller Why is that
    - Shaw We dont know Thats relatively recent knowledge We used to think these channels were so important that they were there forever They disappear and now ones replace it
    - Miller Every hour
    - Shaw Every hour
    - Miller What do you suppose is the evolutionary reason for that I wonder
    - Shaw Its a fascinating question And it speaks to the dynamic nature of the individual cells in the heart and how they probably have to respond to stress And so when say the heart gets an extra stimulus or the heart gets an insult how does it overcome those environmental factors because again the heart needs to beat for the organism to live
    - How is it that the heart can respond so dynamically to many different kinds of stress
    - Miller But doesnt an hour seem like a long time
    - Shaw The overall turnover rate is an hour so thats where honestly the metaphor does fall apart because its not just one Bay Bridge there are many thousands of small bridges that the overall turnover rate for each individual one lasts about an hour
    - Miller So were not without bridges completely theres one disappearing but eh system continues and the one at the back
    - Shaw And thats exactly what we study How is it that on average there is always the same bridges How is it that theres always communication between SF and Oakland How is it in the heart that theres always communication between the heart cells Despite the fact that its so dynamic
    - Miller So what do you think
    - Shaw And so what exists in individual heart cells are highways call it the cyber skeleton Which helps set up the structure of the cells but what were learning is these structural elements of the cells are not just there for structure but there to bring channels to where they need to go And so theyre not just structural components but theyre transport components of the cell And this system breaks down when an arterys blocked
    - And so just to tie it into an earlier question of yours how does sudden cardiac death occur It occurs when a blocked artery causes the heart cells to stop generating these proteins to block these proteins These proteins which are channels dont go where they need to go That causes a decrease in communication between the cells which sets off an arrhythmia which upsets to coordination of the heart
    - Miller So looking at it from the individual point of view what can a person do when we talk about measures they can take to heart health Does this information at all inform prevention methods that people can employ to maintain their own heart health
    - Shaw Thats a good question The best of our knowledge today addresses not so much the muscle of the heart but the arteries that feed the heart And what Im talking about is cholesterol Atherosclerosis coronary artery disease How do we prevent blockages from developing in our arteries
    - In time what I hope this research will lead to is a new kind of therapy for the heart If we accept that were going to have coronary heart disease and were not going to wipe it out there are millions of Americans walking around with damaged hearts who would love to restore health to their damaged hearts and one of the ways we hope to do that is by improving the way the individual heart cells function And by learning more about the biology of the heart cells learning more about how they regulate the proteins which are essential for their function we hope to understand how to improve function when compromised by blocked arteries
    - Miller So this is where the fusion of the MDPhD comes into play you have a unique perspective on this problem
    - Shaw Perhaps not unique but at least informed I do both clinical care and basic science research If you walk into my laboratory its a basic science laboratory no different than any other scientists laboratory at the University The difference if you will in our approach is that the clinical insight informs the questions were asking in the laboratory
    - Miller Is there a specific example other than the more general one on ion channel regulation something that maybe was a question triggered in your mind by a patient that you treated
    - Shaw Absolutely I take care of a lot of patients who have heart failure by definition thats decreased pumping of the heart Most of these patients have suffered damage to the heart as a result of blocked arteries however a good subset of these patients have decreased pump function who have no more arteries And the question is why
    - We term this kind of heart failure idiopathic cardiomyopathy and I like to joke that when we as clinicians call something idiopathic its because we feel like idiots We dont know what causes it
    - Miller Can you give me a percentage
    - Shaw It would be to ten percent of heart failure patients and that depends with age group
    - Miller So the kind of work youre now doing might help to explain this mystery
    - Shaw Absolutely The reason I raise that example is that the basis of heart failure is that the cells dont work well with each other And the individual cells dont work well enough
    - And thats a long ways away from how we traditionally thought about heart failure which is well blocked arteries dont give enough blood supply to the heart therefore if we improve the blood supply the hearts going to come back to its normal function What Im focusing on is not so much the insult but the actual heart cells themselveShaw what causes them to be damaged what is this process of damage at a sub cellular level and when we understand that we can understand how to improve how the individual cells work
    - Miller Clearly this must have implications for congestive heart failure patients as well of which there are millions I believe in the US
    - Shaw There are at least million patients in the US who have heart failure there are halfamillion new heart failure patients that are added to that number per year in the US theres a growing epidemic Part of that is good news
    - Miller How so
    - Shaw laughter Sorry I should explain When patients suffer heart attacks as a result of what we do in the Cath lab as a result of bypass surgery as a result of stents more patients survive their heart attacks But as a result they do suffer heart damage they do suffer heart failure
    - Miller So part of this increase in number is a result of successful other procedures but they do consequences
    - Shaw Thats exactly it So for good reasons and bad heart failure is an increasing health problem in the US
    - Miller You mentioned earlier about a new type of therapeutic medications describe to me how that might actually work
    - Shaw This would be in the form of a drug and when I think about the heart Im thinking about individual cells and when I think about individual cells I dont think about them as amorphous single units Im thinking about them as complex cities going back to that SF and Oakland analogy And so what drugs are out there that can improve the way transportation works in this city And what I mean about transportation I mean how proteins are moved around in the cell To go where they need to go To not go where they shouldnt go And the more we understand of the biology of how these cells work we will therefore be able to use drugs that affect these processes
    - Miller I cant let you go without asking about the potential of stem cells in your work Do you foresee any benefits
    - Shaw Stem cells are obviously a very exciting topic and our investigators are hot on the trail Where the work I do fits into stem cell therapy is that any cells that are injected into the heart will need to communicate with the rest of the heart For example one of the earliest forms of stem cell therapy in humans was taking skeletal muscle precursor cells and injecting them into the heart to improve the hearts ability to contract And what happened from earlier trials that occurred in France is that patients died from arrhythmias and the reason was the cells that were injected did not communicate they may work individually as muscle cells but they couldnt work in concert with thee rest of the heart

    - So where my work comes in is how the cells injected into the heart communicate with the rest of the myocardium And thats going to be I think a very exciting area of research in the next decade

    paragraphs: 
    - Mark Ryder
    - Ever heard the expression floss or die
    - Laugh if you will but there might be some truth to it after all As Mark Ryder DMD chair of the division of periodontology in the UCSF School of Dentistry explains the mouth is both a window on our health and a doorway to disease
    - What kind of disease How about clogged arteries strokes and blood clots That is to say nothing of high blood sugar and an increased incidence of premature births
    - The list is a scary one because the millions of bacteria that clump together in plaque are a bad bunch They secrete toxins They evade the bodys defenses They cause a local inflammatory response far from their source Indeed percent of infections in the body are socalled biofilm infections which adhere in the same way plaque sticks to our teeth
    - No wonder dentists often consider themselves physicians of the mouth Yet the general public not to mention legislators still seem baffled by what Ryder considers gospel Oral health is the key to overall health
    - Why else he wonders would proposed cuts in health assistance to the poor include eliminating dental visits Cutting down on the risk of heart disease would certainly save much more And dentists are often the first to spot signs of unrecognized diseases such as osteoporosis or provide graphic evidence to patients that smoking is ruining their teeth and gums and thereby their health
    - Not that Ryder is standing pat on a soapbox A researcher and teacher as well as a clinician he has begun to study if Vitamin D reduces the effects of inflammation His theory might surprise you

    title: "Floss or Die?: A Conversation with Dental Scientist Mark Ryder"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Mark Ryder
    - Ever heard the expression floss or die
    - Laugh if you will but there might be some truth to it after all As Mark Ryder DMD chair of the division of periodontology in the UCSF School of Dentistry explains the mouth is both a window on our health and a doorway to disease
    - What kind of disease How about clogged arteries strokes and blood clots That is to say nothing of high blood sugar and an increased incidence of premature births
    - The list is a scary one because the millions of bacteria that clump together in plaque are a bad bunch They secrete toxins They evade the bodys defenses They cause a local inflammatory response far from their source Indeed percent of infections in the body are socalled biofilm infections which adhere in the same way plaque sticks to our teeth
    - No wonder dentists often consider themselves physicians of the mouth Yet the general public not to mention legislators still seem baffled by what Ryder considers gospel Oral health is the key to overall health
    - Why else he wonders would proposed cuts in health assistance to the poor include eliminating dental visits Cutting down on the risk of heart disease would certainly save much more And dentists are often the first to spot signs of unrecognized diseases such as osteoporosis or provide graphic evidence to patients that smoking is ruining their teeth and gums and thereby their health
    - Not that Ryder is standing pat on a soapbox A researcher and teacher as well as a clinician he has begun to study if Vitamin D reduces the effects of inflammation His theory might surprise you

    paragraphs: 
    - Orion Weiner
    - Greek mythology doesnt tell us much about Orion the hero whom Zeus tossed into the heavens as a constellation We do know that he was a hunter And so is his namesake UCSF biochemist Orion Weiner PhD This latterday Orion does not hunt deer or lions though He hunts cells or more accurately the guidance systems and circuits that make cells move toward specific destinations
    - Most people understand for example that it is not the cancer tumor that kills but the migration of its malignant cells to other organs or regions of the body
    - Most people also realize that the cells of our immune system have to travel long distances to find their prey a trek that requires clever codes and recognition systems
    - In each case much can go wrong often with dire consequences
    - So it is with surprise and glee that Weiner and his colleagues reported in the summer of that they had serendipitously discovered that white blood cells move toward their targeted invader because signaling proteins churned into a wave machine propel them forward Indeed the researchers were even able to capture the wave motion on video
    - What does this mean Well knowing how cells move suggests ways to stop them when the movement such as metastasizing cancer cells is deadly But perhaps even more important Weiners discovery is yet another validation that systems biology which takes its cues as much from engineering as it does from biology is truly the wave of the future
    - As that wave builds science and human health research will never be the same again

    paragraphs: 
    - Fundamental is a word scientists like to use a lot Fundamental knowledge Fundamental insight Fundamental discovery Well you get the idea
    - But it is the deeper thinkers the activist intellectuals who aim their research squarely at fundamental truths Their goal is underlying principles the unity behind the patterns Adam Gazzaley MD PhD is one of that breed Gazzaley an accomplished nature photographer as well as director of UCSFs Neuroscience Imaging Center has set his sights on the baby boomers biggest lament Why is my brain sagging along with my skin
    - To answer that question Gazzaley seeks to understand how a brain actually ages and then to quantify in human testing what processing power is lost He wants to nail down the neural interfaces between attention and memory and focus and filtering And he needs to track how brain regions team up to store and retrieve information
    - Maybe just maybe he concedes all of the various effects associated with an aging brain can be traced to the bottom of some cognitive pyramid Just how deep into that pyramid Gazzaley has already explored should be encouraging to those who sometimes forget where they have parked their car or who find the names even of old friends harder to retrieve
    - In short Adam Gazzaley could one day be the scientist behind the new drug the new device or the new brain exercise that makes us remember what we have lost That alone would make him hard to forget

    paragraphs: 
    - Dan Ganem
    - Its not often that a scientist confesses that he has well lost interest in science Not science per se but the kind of research that concentrates on what is genetically conserved across species from yeast to humans
    - Don Ganem MD is such a scientist A UCSF physician with a researchers heart and a teachers passion he values most what is different about humans because that is where he can learn the most about infectious disease
    - And in a career spanning more than two decades Ganem has learned a lot Kaposis sarcoma has been a particular target KS is a sometimes disfiguring cancer known by its raised purplishred nodules and blotches that often appear on the face mouth and limbs As many of us might recall KS can become an aggressive disease in those with HIVweakened immune systems
    - A decade ago Ganem and his colleagues determined that KS was in fact caused by a novel herpesvirus called human herpesvirus While the age of retroviral drugs has now largely banished KS from the lives of HIVpositive patients the virus lingers on in latent form
    - Among other objectives Ganem and his research collaborators now seek to know how this novel human herpesvirus becomes unstable and how other viruses replicate as well
    - These are exactly the kinds of medical mysteries Ganem prefers and relishes After all our genome tells us that viruses have been a part of human existence almost from the beginning That makes them very special indeed

    paragraphs: 
    - Thiennu Vu
    - Breathing is such an unconscious event except when it isnt Then and only then do we get a suffocating sense of how dependent we are on our efficient and expertly packed lungs to keep us both alive and energized
    - UCSFs Thiennu Vu MD PhD needs no firsthand reminders Indeed she chose to study lung biology in large part because of the suffering of others shed witnessed on hospital wards
    - And because therapies are in short supply Vu decided to do something about it in the laboratory But first she needed to uncover the developmental clues behind the wondrously simple way in which air and blood are brought together
    - Sure everyone knows we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide But the system that allows this exchange of gases takes physical shape under rules we have yet to learn

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im with Thiennu Vu an associate professor of medicine at UCSF welcome Thiennu
    - Thiennu Vu Thank you very much
    - Miller Now as anyone who regularly listens to Science caf knows Im particularly fond of MVPhDs so I need to ask you right off the bat how long did it take you to get both degrees
    - Vu It took me years
    - Miller years That seems a little shorter than some Ive heard
    - Vu I think its about the average Some take longer some take shorter
    - Miller Is it true that MVPhDs have a special perspective on their world primarily because they occupy two both the clinical side and the research side do you feel you have a little special perspective on problems
    - Vu I think that I do I think my medical training helps me to see scientific problems in a different way I tend to think of things that I can do that would help patients eventually so I ask scientific questions not only for the intellectual curiosity but also whether it is going to be good for patient care
    - Miller And that may not be true for someone who is really delving deep down into more basic scientific questions because they never see patients
    - Vu That could be true but I also know PhDs who ask questions of relevance to medical care But that may not be on their mind as much as it is mine
    - Miller In your case Were going to be talking about your work with lungs and lung biology and lung development in just a second but Im curious to know is there anything in your training along the way was there some pivotal moment that turned you toward your current research focus maybe a patient problem a problem of a relative anything like that
    - Vu I think I got into pulmonary medicine first when I got into my clinical training and I got interested in pulmonary medicine because I noticed the lack of really therapeutic treatment for a lot of the lung diseases that was true when I was going through training and continues to be true now
    - Miller Lets get a list of lung diseases so everyone is on the same page
    - Vu The common diseases are asthma COPD or emphysema interstitial lung diseases lung cancer and some of the infectious diseases such as pneumonia
    - Miller So when youve seen patients with lung diseases did that trigger your interest
    - Vu Yes Patients with lung diseases suffer a lot it is a very uncomfortable and scary feeling when you cannot breathe And because the lack of effective treatment it really motivated me to try to do research to learn more about lung diseases so that we can come up with better treatment for these patients
    - And the other factor that motivated me to go into pulmonary medicine was patients in intensive care units The patients are very ill critically ill and theyre at moments of their lives when basically they cannot do anything but entrust themselves into the care of physicians and the families also are very concerned and worried about the patients And a lot of the patients in critical care units are there because of lung problems also so that also motivated me to go into pulmonary medicine
    - Miller So how much time do you spend seeing patients and working in the lab at this point in your career
    - Vu Currently I spend about twenty percent doing clinical medicine and the rest in the lab
    - Miller I know you came to the US from Vietnam when you were were there any members of your family who had a medical background and what prompted you to even consider a career in medicine or science
    - Vu Theres no one in my family who was in medicine or science and actually when I was growing up I never thought about going into medicine but I always wanted to be a scientist even when I was a child
    - Miller And How did you know that as a child was there something in particular you were interested in were you very curious about why things worked How did that manifest itself
    - Vu This is actually a very funny reason because when I was growing up I dont know if you have seen or heard of a series of movies about Godzilla
    - Miller Sure of course
    - Vu laughter They were very popular when I was growing up my dad used to take us to see Godzilla movies a lot and in these movies the heroes are always these scientist in white coats trying to save the world
    - Miller And you wanted to be one of those people
    - Vu I wanted to be one of those people trying to save the world from Godzilla
    - Miller And now youre tackling lung disease So I think everyone understands on the most basic level that we breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide but how do the lungs actually make that happen
    - Vu Im glad you asked that question because the lungs are very complex but beautiful organs I guess you know the function of the lung is to bring oxygen and blood together so that we can exchange gas Oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide waste products into the air And it has to do that very efficiently so it has to move air in and out of the lungs very efficient and quickpace so when were sitting talking were moving maybe or liters of air per minute
    - Miller Just now as were sitting and talking were moving that much
    - Vu Yes And you need to move air in order to speak When you exercise you increase that capacity as well up to maybe twenty or thirty liters per minute
    - And then you have to bring the air into contact with the blood over a very large surface area so gas can diffuse between the two compartments very quickly as well
    - Miller How big a surface area I forget the actual measurements of the lung when you lay it out flat
    - Vu About the size of a tennis court About meters square is the total surface of the gas exchange area of the lungs It has a series of conduits which is the airways to bring air in and out of the lungs very quickly And then it has this total surface area which is very large but the problem is it has to fit all of that into the small chest cavity as well so how do you fold up this large surface area with systems of conduits inside the chest cavity That is a very complex problem
    - Miller And this is a problem of development how the organ actually develops how it takes shape as well as the structural integrity of it
    - Vu Exactly
    - Miller Is there anything special about the human lungs Are they fundamentally different in some way
    - Vu Its not different from other mammalian lungs so its very similar to primate lungs or rogan lungs but its different from avian lungs for example from the lungs of the birds
    - Miller Are human lungs among mammals the largest the strongest somewhere in between
    - Vu I think its not the largest its certainly not the smallest its somewhere in between
    - Miller The exchange that goes on at the alveoli level is that something that is particularly complicated I know its obviously essential and is it tied into some fashion in the way the lungs actually develop
    - Vu The gas exchange
    - Miller Yes
    - Vu Its simple you just have to bring air and blood together very closely separated by very thin membrane so that the gas can diffuse freely very quickly So the development of the lungs how to make that happen is the complicated part
    - Miller Now are you studying at this point in your research the actual development of the lung itself
    - Vu Yes I have been studying lung development especially the development of the gas exchange surface or the alveoli
    - Miller And what have you learned so far
    - Vu What I have focused on is how the development of the vasculature is regulated How it develops and how it contributes to the development of the airways And the reason I focus on that area is because in the lung particularly because of the function of the lung that it needs to bring air and blood close together you really need to bring the blood vessels very close together with the airways And so there has to be crosstalk The two systems when they develop they have to talk to each other so that they develop at the same rate the same time in the same spatial relationship
    - Miller In a normal situation are the blood vessels very densely packed in the tissue or is it kind of a thin network
    - Vu It depends on each different organ so in each organ the vasculature has a very particular relationship with the tissue so in some tissues it could be very dense in some tissues more sparse
    - Miller So now youre studying how this develops clearly in doing so youre learning how things go wrong so what does that tell you Are these genetic influences Is it the way the genes are not responding correctly in the course of development that underlines some of these lung problems which Im sure if thats the case develop early in a persons life
    - Vu There are definitely genetic influences in the lung development because if you alter the expression of several of the genes weve been studying you definitely see abnormalities in the development of the lungs So what weve been focusing on is what regulates the vascular development and we have identified one of the genes that are critical for that it is called vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF which is a very essential factor regulating blood vessel development in many different organs
    - And that regulates how the vasculature develops And if we alter the expression of that factor we inhibit the development of the vessels and then you also alter or impair the development of the airways
    - Miller Is the mutation in that gene fairly common and if so would it show up as something dramatic in a newborn of would it be something more progressive
    - Vu Uh
    - Miller And before you answer could defects in that system contribute to the development of asthma and other things
    - Vu The mutations of these genes have not been reported I think because it is such an important factor for blood vessel development that any mutations that cause alteration in its expression probably are not viable
    - Miller So the fetus would not be viable
    - Vu Exactly But there could be alteration in expression not because of mutation but because of environmental factors For example in babies who are born very prematurely and they have to be placed on supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and this could alter the expression of this growth factor because they are exposed to higher level of oxygen prematurely
    - When the fetus is in the womb the oxygen level is not as high as if you place them on supplemental oxygen
    - Miller And have there been studies of premature infants as they grow up showing greater signs of lung problems
    - Vu Yes So these premature babies placed on supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation sometimes do not survive And when they survive they develop a disease we call chronic lung disease of prematurity And that causes them to have a lot of lung problems as a child and when they grow older as well
    - Miller Does the percentage of impairment vary from person to person Are we talking loss of function or greater or what
    - Vu It varies for individuals depending on how severe the damage is when they are born
    - Miller And that would mean since the really tiny preemies would be in the oxygen longer if they survive then their lung impairment later in life would be greater
    - Vu Exactly
    - Miller I know you are studying too the possibility of using adult stem cells to somehow repair lung tissues is that correct
    - Vu Yes Im interested in seeing whether there are resident or stem cells that reside in the lungs themselves that can repair lungs after damage And right now this is not our work but other people have identified a population of what seem to be stem cells in the lungs And they reside at the very end of the airways before the airways branch out into alveoli
    - Miller Was that a surprise to find stem cells at that location
    - Vu In retrospect its not surprising because if you think about the analogy of a tree right now is cherry blossom season so when you look at a cherry tree in blossom you can think of the airways as the tree and the branches of the tree and the blossoms as the alveoli And when the blossoms are gone you just have the braches of the tree left but theres still something there at the tips of the branches so that the next season the leaves will come out the blossoms will arise again
    - So it could be like that with the lungs At the end of the airways theres something there that can be redeveloped into alveoli So that makes me think that the location is not surprising But whether these few cells that we have found that have stem cell properties at this location can really redevelop and reform the whole sets of alveoli again you know like whatever buds are left at the tip of the tree can form the blossoms again is not clear
    - Miller But wouldnt these buds perhaps be damaged by the disease itself
    - Vu Possibly Possibly Right now we actually have not been able to identify instances where the lungs actually regenerate following disease or damage
    - Miller Is this something youre exploring though in your research
    - Vu Exactly Yes
    - Miller Are you very early into to it Are we many years away from having any kind of answer Are there lots of people working on this or is this a specialty of yours
    - Vu There are a few people a few groups working on this I think there will be more because I think were still far from being able to induce the lungs to regenerate Probably not in the near future
    - Miller Im not going to put you on the spot and say how many years before a cure
    - Vu laughter
    - Miller Now Im going to ask you to put your clinical hat on for a second were near the end of our science caf interview for today Is there anything people can do apart from not smoking obviously to protect their lungs and health Is there a way to increase capacity obviously theres exercise what would be some dos and donts
    - Vu Im not sure if theres anything you can really do to improve your lung health besides trying not to cause damage to the lungs by smoking or by exposing your lungs to toxic chemicals or fumes or pollutions
    - Miller So if you paint at home wear a mask these kinds of things
    - Vu Yes Try to avoid breathing in fumes smokes chemicals that nay cause damage to the lungs
    - Miller Just a question that occurred to me are you ever approached by groups on the outside that may be complaining that theyve been exposed to something in the air and youre asked to offer your professional advice Just curious
    - Vu I havent been so far
    - Miller Thank you very much for joining me on Science caf still stuck in my head is that image of my lungs splayed across a tennis court Ill never think of them in quite the same way Thank you for that and good luck in your research
    - Vu Thank you very much

    paragraphs: 
    - Thiennu Vu
    - Breathing is such an unconscious event except when it isnt Then and only then do we get a suffocating sense of how dependent we are on our efficient and expertly packed lungs to keep us both alive and energized
    - UCSFs Thiennu Vu MD PhD needs no firsthand reminders Indeed she chose to study lung biology in large part because of the suffering of others shed witnessed on hospital wards
    - And because therapies are in short supply Vu decided to do something about it in the laboratory But first she needed to uncover the developmental clues behind the wondrously simple way in which air and blood are brought together
    - Sure everyone knows we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide But the system that allows this exchange of gases takes physical shape under rules we have yet to learn
    - And what if we do Well the unfolded surface of our lungs would fill a tennis court That alone should make the lungs worthy of our interest But imagine the possibilities if we could somehow stimulate the adult stem cells recently found in the lung to repair damaged tissue Think asthma emphysema lung cancer
    - This is the stuff of heroic science just like that practiced by the men and women in white coats who saved the world in the Godzilla movies of Vus youth She was inspired then to become a scientist She hopes others will now follow her

    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Enzymes really need to hire a publicist Genes had been hogging the headlines for years until proteins with a capital P pushed them aside Now you can read about big proteins everywhere But enzymes those cutups in the protein classroom have never had their day in the sun Maybe we can blame it on those biotech companies with the odd monikers Enzymes sound like a name nobody liked
    - That nots true of pharmaceutical chemist Brian Shoichet PhD who last year pushed enzymes into the spotlight at last His big discovery Figuring out a way to determine what an enzyme does by how it is shaped
    - The model enzyme he used TM lives in boiling water at the bottom of the Mediterranean Original software created in Shoichets School of Pharmacy lab which is designed to find patterns in the metabolites or byproducts of TM coupled with computers that are at least times faster than those used just two decades ago soon detected a pattern
    - Brian Shoichet
    - A little more sleuthing and a lot of chemistry later Shoichet had the proof he needed TM it seems has a special affinity for adenosine a messenger molecule in all forms of life
    - What does this mean to us Well we dont live near a volcanic ocean vent So on the surface the discovery seems interesting but hardly a wavemaker
    - Better think again The technological approach developed in Shoichets lab could save pharmaceutical companies huge amounts of time and money now spent in following false drug leads suggested by less sophisticated methods And that approach is a direct benefit to human health
    - Apart from that Shoichet explains with a smile many theoretical discoveries turn out to have very practical applications yet another reminder that the best science is often the most unscripted kind

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im with Brian Shoichet a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the UCSF School of Pharmacy welcome Brian
    - Brian Shoichet Great to be here
    - Miller Im going to start off with a big question at the moment When you look at the state of science in the US today what do you see are the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities and how do those play out in your lab
    - Shoichet Im not expert in that sort of policy area but the two biggest challenges to science are always funding we always feel like were under funded and right now its particularly acute with what we call the flat funding of the NIH it hasnt grown for years inflation has grown and science inflation is higher for the average economist so thats a big hit its particularly bad for junior scientists just coming into the field Its a much harder time now for them than it was for me when I was starting out
    - For my lab were sort of set and can muddle through this tough time but for them its very hard with sort of our seat corners being eaten
    - Miller I know theres a lot of talk on the impact of graduate education does that play out at all in your lab
    - Shoichet We dont see that effect so strongly but were sort of in a great position here in UCSF because were one of the premiere flagship institutions on science and the problems hit us last For the second tier and thats not meant to be disparaging in any way institutions you know I was at North Western for the first six years of my career and they have a tougher time of it than we do
    - Were also starting to feel the pain but they cut us last
    - Miller Were you the first scientist in your family
    - Shoichet In my immediate family yes I almost said no because my sister and I are almost the same age and shes also a scientist
    - Miller What does she study
    - Shoichet Shes a chemist a biomaterial chemist
    - Miller Were there other members of your family
    - Shoichet No theyre all business people and lawyers
    - Miller So how did this turn toward science come about
    - Shoichet My father is more of an engineering type so many that had something to do with it we had great science teachers in school I think that was the biggest part of it
    - Miller And you grew up in
    - Shoichet Toronto Canada
    - Miller Do you get the chance to read a lot
    - Shoichet Yes a lot of history when Im not reading science
    - Miller What kind of history intellectual history or
    - Shoichet Well its all sort of intellectual history so now Im reading a book by Tony Jut called Post War its about Europe after the second world war thats very modern history
    - Miller If I remember correctly you were a history major right
    - Shoichet Yes
    - Miller So why the turn towards science
    - Shoichet Well I was at MIT so laughter so the history was just a sidebar for me I was a chemist
    - Miller So I know youve been at UCSF for a number of years
    - Shoichet Almost five
    - Miller Can you give me a quick explanation of what molecular docking is and why UCSF has a reputation in this area
    - Shoichet Molecular docking is the attempt to fit druglike molecules organic molecules into the structures of the biological molecules that are meant to receive them The idea is you start off with typically a protein enzyme structure where you know the position of every atom and thats no joke because the atoms are very small and there is among the order of three thousand of them and they are all connected so theres a lot of moving pieces so its this very complicated puzzle And what youre trying to do is fit the last piece or two into that puzzle and that last piece or two are the substraits or the inhibitors the things the enzyme will react with or the things that will stop the enzyme from reacting
    - Miller And being able to visualize this was one of the big milestones
    - Shoichet Yes That started to become possible in the mid s and that was technology that was pioneered here by a guy named Bob Langrigch at UCSF I became involved in the late s as a graduate student actually I was here at UCSF at the time with a guy named Tack Kuntz and he developed the methods to try and fit the organic molecules the druglike molecules into these three thousand atom structures For a chemist three thousand molecules is a giant molecule The molecules the drugs that were trying to fit in were like atoms much much smaller But its like fitting the last piece of the puzzle the problem is the reason you need to do this with computers is that the puzzles the proteins are so complicated theyre like these molecular canyons imagine Bryce canyon and youre trying to stick a wedgelike rock into Bryce canyon to plug a little bit of it up thats about the size scale
    - And there are all these different places you can put it
    - Miller Did it take huge advances in computing power to make what is possible today
    - Shoichet Yes laughter in computing power and in our understanding of how the pieces fit together
    - Miller So proteins are your bread and butter obviously give me some idea of the type of research programs you have going on in your lab at the moment
    - Shoichet Mostly were interested in technologies around drug discovery and the idea is you start with the structure of the protein and proteins are the things that do everything in the body so from thinking to salivating to digestion its all proteins and so thats a good place to start And drugs mediate their actions by binding to proteins The things you sallow get digested they go into the blood stream and then they all bind to specific protein molecules So our projects are mostly around developing these technologies to predict what will bind where
    - Miller And what success have you had so far
    - Shoichet Weve had a lot of success I think driving the technologies and understanding early problems in the discovery for instance weve had success in starting with the protein structure and coming up with completely new templates that will bind to that structure And weve had success understanding some of the false hits that come up in drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry
    - Miller What is a false hit exactly
    - Shoichet A molecule that looks like its binding to the protein because its inhibiting its action for instance but actually is doing something completely different It is inhibiting it but its inhibiting it for some pathological reason like its precipitating it
    - Miller So it might actually be causing a problem
    - Shoichet Yes theyre often very nonspecific and at UCSF a major focus is this computer based method where youll take a million molecules and youll screen them using a computer to take each molecule fly it into this Bryce canyon and predict if it will bind but in the pharmaceutical industry theyll literally take a million molecules and experimentally test each one and you think oh well that seems better than using a computer program because you get the real answer but it turns out that their answers are clouded by a dense fog of false hits and figuring out what is really working and what isnt is their number one problem and thats an area of interest for us too
    - Miller What is the ah ha moment when you know you actually have a lockup mechanism something happen on the screen or is there a change in the conformation of the protein in the screen or how do you even know what youre looking at
    - Shoichet Simulations are the place where we start but we never end there the ah ha moment comes at am in the lab when youre looking at the actual experimental results and you say oh boy it really worked The computer is just a guide to the actual wet chemistry experiment which we also do in our lab
    - Miller But it speeds up the process because you can eliminate a lot of possibilities
    - Shoichet Oh yeah its huge we wouldnt get anywhere without the computer simulations
    - Miller Can we gauge how much faster things are these days Is it a hundred times faster than it used to be years ago or have you ever thought about it in those terms
    - Shoichet In terms of computer power its at least a thousand times faster but on top of that the methods for doing things have also improved So in that sense maybe youd say we were ten thousand times better now than we were years ago
    - Miller I want to go back to this false hits thing for a second is it possible that a false hits might explain a disease state that was otherwise unknown because you could actually have identified and negative something that turns into something interesting
    - Shoichet I cant rule that out but most of our discoveries have been in the area of weeding out molecules that look like theyre doing something good but in fact are not doing anything useful
    - Miller OK I know there was a lot of publicity about a paper that was published last summer I believe about enzymes why dont you tell me about that
    - Shoichet This is one of the grand ideas in our field which is if you know what enzyme looks like you can figure out what it does And now these days we have a lot of pictures of enzymes of these Bryce canyon molecules and for many of them we know what they look like but dont know what they do So the idea was could we start with the structure of the enzyme and from first principles predict what it did and so we started off with a structure of an enzyme from this bacteria Thermotoga Maritima which is a very arcane little bacteria well I dont know how little it is it lives on sea vents hot ocean vents in the Mediterranean It
    - Miller Only in the Mediterranean
    - Shoichet As far as I know but it has cousins that live in ocean vents all over the place There are this class of bacteria called thermophilic or Hyperthermophilic bacteria that live in basically boiling water at the bottom of the oceans at extremely high pressures parenthetically is one of those amazing things about molecular evolution life has spread all over this planet there is few places where it cant find a niche and these bacteria are an example of that
    - Anyway they produce an enzyme which was called TM for Thermotoga Maritima didnt have a real name because nobody knew what it did and so our goal was to figure out what it did and it was sort of a proof of concept study for us could we do it for this enzyme where we had really structure because if we could maybe we could do it for lots of others
    - Miller And how big a structure are we talking about
    - Miller OK so you have the atom you have the structure you know what you want to do how did you get to the result that you ultimately did
    - Shoichet We said well lets assume that this enzyme works on metabolites those are things in the body and in this case the bacterium that the bacteria has to deal with and to convert foreign sources of molecules into food or energy or things it can build with And we assume it will interact with one of those and there were about of those maybe more
    - And then we said well lets take each one of them and fly them into the site of this protein and figure out which one does it recognize
    - Miller And how long did it take you before you found the recognition pattern
    - Shoichet The calculation in itself is pretty quick a couple of days
    - Miller Only a couple of days
    - Shoichet But we had to do it multiple times because no one had ever done this before and we were feeling our way and so we would sort of boot strap our way until the patterned emerged and we had to invent the technology to do it there were differences in what we normally do technically
    - Miller What type of technology did you need to create
    - Shoichet We had to Enzymes catalyze reactions Usually were interested in a drug that will be the last puzzle piece that will fit and stop the enzyme from working Enzymes have to break molecules apart or put them together and that involves chemical reactions and real changes in the structure so its like breaking the puzzle piece in two for instance And to do that we have to change how we modeled molecular flexibility and the basic structure We had to predict what the reaction would actually be
    - Miller Is this a software coding
    - Shoichet Yes
    - Miller So its all programming you have people in your lab that do this
    - Shoichet Yes we have a very talented postdoctoral fellow named Johannes Herman who has now gone on to work at Rosch Pharmaceuticals
    - Miller So here we are so youre testing this out you have results in a couple of days and you keep testing to make sure theres a pattern that emerges and then what
    - Shoichet What was really exciting was a pattern did emerge All the molecules that scored best by this method were derivatives of adenosine and adenosine is a well known molecule that is used as a messenger in all forms of life and its also a precursor to one of the DNA bases adenosine monophosphate so its a really essential molecule in all forms of life from bacteria to humans and everything inbetween And what we found was adenosine and all sorts of variations of adenosine that are used in metabolism scored at the top of the list and what this told us was according to the docking program its the derivative adenosine thats being recognized and not only that they were all recognized the same way they were all undergoing exactly the same reaction its called the deanimation reaction where nitrogen is hydrolyzed by an incoming water and leaves and replaced by an oxygen And that would produce a second very well known metabolite called anisine
    - And based on that we thought maybe it was adenosine so we tested that with our collaborators in Texas at Frank Brushells lab and it turned out to be true
    - Miller So what does this tell us now
    - Shoichet It tells us that this enzyme works on adenosine and what it also told us which we didnt know before was that this bacteria has a whole set of enzymes around this reaction that create the precursors for this reaction and take the products of this reaction on so its what you call a metabolic pathway We knew about some of the other enzymes but we didnt know they were connected with this one And once we knew what this guy did the scales sort of fell from our eyes and we could see that there was an entire metabolic pathway in Thermotoga Maritimas who cares devoted to these transformations on Adenasine
    - Well it turns out that this pathway seems like it exists in at least other bacteria as well and probably in many others so it looks like its a conserved pathway for converting metabolic molecules from one state to another and at least its wide spread in bacteria
    - Miller So when we talked at the beginning about drug discovery how does this relate to new and better drugs just in theory
    - Shoichet Well its the technology that matters I mean Thermotoga Maritima is not a pathogen it lives at degrees centigrade so I dont know what that is in Fahrenheit but extremely hot and doesnt live in humans so its not a threat to us or livestock or anything But the method could be quite useful for predicting substrates and for predicting what you call receptor agonist things that turn receptors on and off Because its one of the really early studies that show that you can capture not only how to inhibit an enzyme but figure out what it does
    - So how would it be used in drug discovery Its the discovery of other things like that for enzymes that are pharmaceutically interesting and relevant
    - Miller We often hear that the basic science like this youve made this fundamental discovery about bacteria but it doesnt necessarily translate immediately to human benefit and theres a lot of money invested in it so what do you say to people who question whether or not this really has any long term value that its really an indulgence to have scientists continue to explore in this fashion when theres really not guarantee there will be any pay off at the end
    - Shoichet Well thats for sure true there is no guarantee for any given scientific research program but overall the scientific enterprise has proved itself over and over again and I think when you look at life saving drugs and the changes in medical technology upon which we all depend those have all come from basic research and its expensive because a lot of it turns out to be interesting and yet theres no immediate practical relevance that can be seen but every field of science builds on this massive body of knowledge and things work out in strange ways things that seem very theoretical turn out to have a practical benefit down the road
    - So when people say well really shouldnt we be spending our money on feeding the poor I think we should be spending our money on feeding the poor but for our heavily technological society investment in science seems to me is completely critical And I guess its what they used to say about the space program you dont know exactly which result is going to pay off and it would be unwise to try and script that too heavily because were supposed to discover new things who knows how a new thing will play out But what we can say is theres a desperate need for new things to make our lives better and those of our children
    - Miller Last question whats next for you on your research agenda are you going to continue with this study or are there new things in the works
    - Shoichet Yes yes were still super excited with this result you know it came out in a journal called Nature which among scientists is the big journal so were excited by that reception
    - One of the other really exciting things that were dealing with right now is predicting side effects and off target effects for drugs theres this saying show me a drug that doesnt have side effects and Ill show you a drug that doesnt have any effects whatsoever so what were trying to do now is computationally predict what the side effects will be and also what we can exploit
    - It turns out that a lot of drugs that have been discovered were this is an example of the unpredictability of science a lot of the drugs that have had a huge effect were developed for one thing and it turns out that they had an application in a completely different field because of some side effect which turned out to be a really interesting and useful side effect were trying to predict those So thats an exciting area for us
    - Miller That would be very exciting Brian thank you so much for joining us on Science Caf
    - Shoichet My pleasure thanks for having me

    title: "Lights, Camera, Enzymes!: A Conversation with Chemist and Protein Expert Brian Shoichet"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Enzymes really need to hire a publicist Genes had been hogging the headlines for years until proteins with a capital P pushed them aside Now you can read about big proteins everywhere But enzymes those cutups in the protein classroom have never had their day in the sun Maybe we can blame it on those biotech companies with the odd monikers Enzymes sound like a name nobody liked
    - That nots true of pharmaceutical chemist Brian Shoichet PhD who last year pushed enzymes into the spotlight at last His big discovery Figuring out a way to determine what an enzyme does by how it is shaped
    - The model enzyme he used TM lives in boiling water at the bottom of the Mediterranean Original software created in Shoichets School of Pharmacy lab which is designed to find patterns in the metabolites or byproducts of TM coupled with computers that are at least times faster than those used just two decades ago soon detected a pattern
    - Brian Shoichet
    - A little more sleuthing and a lot of chemistry later Shoichet had the proof he needed TM it seems has a special affinity for adenosine a messenger molecule in all forms of life
    - What does this mean to us Well we dont live near a volcanic ocean vent So on the surface the discovery seems interesting but hardly a wavemaker
    - Better think again The technological approach developed in Shoichets lab could save pharmaceutical companies huge amounts of time and money now spent in following false drug leads suggested by less sophisticated methods And that approach is a direct benefit to human health
    - Apart from that Shoichet explains with a smile many theoretical discoveries turn out to have very practical applications yet another reminder that the best science is often the most unscripted kind

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im with Brian Shoichet a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the UCSF School of Pharmacy welcome Brian
    - Brian Shoichet Great to be here
    - Miller Im going to start off with a big question at the moment When you look at the state of science in the US today what do you see are the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities and how do those play out in your lab
    - Shoichet Im not expert in that sort of policy area but the two biggest challenges to science are always funding we always feel like were under funded and right now its particularly acute with what we call the flat funding of the NIH it hasnt grown for years inflation has grown and science inflation is higher for the average economist so thats a big hit its particularly bad for junior scientists just coming into the field Its a much harder time now for them than it was for me when I was starting out
    - For my lab were sort of set and can muddle through this tough time but for them its very hard with sort of our seat corners being eaten
    - Miller I know theres a lot of talk on the impact of graduate education does that play out at all in your lab
    - Shoichet We dont see that effect so strongly but were sort of in a great position here in UCSF because were one of the premiere flagship institutions on science and the problems hit us last For the second tier and thats not meant to be disparaging in any way institutions you know I was at North Western for the first six years of my career and they have a tougher time of it than we do
    - Were also starting to feel the pain but they cut us last
    - Miller Were you the first scientist in your family
    - Shoichet In my immediate family yes I almost said no because my sister and I are almost the same age and shes also a scientist
    - Miller What does she study
    - Shoichet Shes a chemist a biomaterial chemist
    - Miller Were there other members of your family
    - Shoichet No theyre all business people and lawyers
    - Miller So how did this turn toward science come about
    - Shoichet My father is more of an engineering type so many that had something to do with it we had great science teachers in school I think that was the biggest part of it

    - It turns out that a lot of drugs that have been discovered were this is an example of the unpredictability of science a lot of the drugs that have had a huge effect were developed for one thing and it turns out that they had an application in a completely different field because of some side effect which turned out to be a really interesting and useful side effect were trying to predict those So thats an exciting area for us
    - Miller That would be very exciting Brian thank you so much for joining us on Science Caf
    - Shoichet My pleasure thanks for having me

    - Most adults can recall a moment when theyve been afraid Danger or the presumption of danger jacks up both our senses and our stress hormones and lingers in our memory
    - It was once assumed that infants lacked similar sensory awareness Not true says Alicia Lieberman PhD a UCSF professor of psychiatry who has spent her career trying to prevent and undo the emotional damage inflicted on very young children stuck in violenceprone homes
    - Left untreated this damage thwarts development stunts IQs and spawns anxiety that can last a lifetime This is to say nothing of the damage to social harmony and community life or the impact on productivity and crime rates all of which we pay for in one way or another
    - Lieberman has not stood on the sidelines simply decrying this state of affairs She has instead designed interventions that mend and cement the healthy and loving relationships between mothers and their young troubled children Moreover in a followup study she has found that the relationshipbased interventions she designed had lasting positive effects
    - No wonder then that she was asked to speak about her work and her findings to the Dalai Lama and other guests at a recent meeting in Seattle To those who take the long view it is clear that the seeds of compassion and the experience of violence begin in the womb Lieberman has codified that balance And maybe if we listen really hard she can teach us all how to behave

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today I am with Alicia Lieberman Director of the Child Trauma Research Project at San Francisco General Hospital and a professor in the UCSF Department of Psychiatry Welcome Alicia
    - Alicia Lieberman Thank you for having me Jeff
    - Miller Id like some background information to begin with how long have you been at UCSF and maybe more specifically at SFGH
    - Lieberman Ive been at UCSF and SFGH since
    - Miller And always as a professor of psychiatry
    - Lieberman I started as an assistant professor and then worked my through the ranks
    - Miller so psychiatry Certainly there were a lot of other fields you might have been tempted by so why did you end up here
    - Lieberman Im actually a psychologist so I could have been in the department of psychology or an academic institution but Im very interested in treatment of children and families that have emotional problems And so UCSF seemed like the perfect place and SF General hospital because its located in the Mission and serves families with many many stresses
    - Miller So for those who might not know the Mission District in San Francisco is a mix of lots of ethnic groups began primarily with Hispanics but now contains people from all over the world at this point
    - Lieberman Correct
    - Miller So did you come from a family of scientists
    - Lieberman My father was a pediatrician and my mother was a dentist and both of them had their offices at home in my native Paraguay So I spent a lot of time during my childhood in the waiting room talking with the children who were coming to see my father who was renown as somebody who said love and vitamins as the ingredients for healthy development
    - Miller Love and vitamins I love that
    - Lieberman laughter
    - Miller Families have continued to be the focus of your work particularly the violence in families and its effects on young children But before kind of narrowing the focus I wonder what is your opinion of the state of family today particularly as it relates to violence
    - Lieberman I believe that families reflect the gap between the haves and the havenots in our society There are families who are doing very very well who are wealthy healthy loving and affluent and who provide their children with all the conditions they need to develop optimally and there are a large number of families that are falling behind because they have fewer and fewer resources to support themselves and their children And as a result the US ranks third in a list of industrialized countries in the number of children who die as result of maltreatment So the situation in the US is very dire when it comes to protecting young children
    - Miller Youth in America is described as a fairly long period of time but youve chosen to select infants for your particular area of focus why is that
    - Lieberman Infants represent the period of life where the fastest changes occur both in brain development and in learning And in infancy also parents are particularly motivated to look at themselves experience themselves in relationship with their children and try to make changes in the way they respond
    - Babies have a very transformative effect on people And when somebody becomes a parent there is a sense of new beginnings and I want to take advantage of that opening to create positive change
    - Miller In your years at SFGH where you attuned to rising levels of violence and I want to go back to something you said earlier were you speaking about economic resources as being the primary stress in the lives of people causing an increase in violence or is it something else in addition to that
    - Lieberman Economic resources go hand in hand with psychological resources and sociological resources and we know for example that violence is growing in many neighborhoods and in those neighborhoods there is a concomitant decrease in resources such as safe streets clean parks playgrounds for children grocery stores that serve healthy food environments that do not have toxins like lead and other resources that are made possible by financial funds
    - Miller The stress and violence in the home I would imagine were not speaking always of physical violence to infants can it just be an atmosphere of danger and hostility that the infants pick up upon and transform that into some form of behavior
    - Lieberman There is a lot of research indicating a child does not have to be mistreated him or herself to suffer from the effects of violence For example children who witness domestic violence without being maltreated themselves have IQ scores significantly lower than a comparison group that did not witness domestic violence
    - Community violence is also very destructive although it has not been studied as systematically as domestic violence So the mere fact that children are witnesses of violence is already damaging to their well being
    - Miller Even when theyre infants and some assume theyre not absorbing this atmosphere in fact they are
    - Lieberman One of the most important findings over the last years is that there is no such thing as a baby not noticing what is happening And babies who are exposed to violence have difficulties eating sleeping gaining weight learning that can thwart their developmental course in very dramatic ways
    - Miller Is that true during gestation as well
    - Lieberman We are now working with pregnant women and finding that babies born to women who have been battered have a higher rate of perinatal complications and this is not just our finds theres a lot of research showing that actually exposure to domestic violence during pregnancy can have more deleterious effects than physical conditions that are routinely screened for such as exposure to toxins and other medical problems
    - Miller So what would be some of these effects that one would see
    - Lieberman Low birth weight premature birth perinatal complications during delivery difficulty being soothed and there are some studies showing the cortisol level in babies the stress hormones in babies born to depressed and battered women is higher than the cortisol level of babies born to women who are not either distressed or battered
    - So there is some evidence that the physiological state of the mother affects the physiological state of the fetus
    - Miller So were talking about an enormous social problem these infants born compromised and then growing up perhaps in a climate of violence or even if not they start out with a problem and this is then multiplied over time so what do you see as the price to society for this type of neglect without blaming anyone of course just curious
    - Lieberman The price to society is the decline in social climate including a decline in productivity There is data showing on the contrary that investment in the first three years of life has the best predictive role in creating positive change so the infancy years are very important in shaping the kind of society we live in
    - Miller You have seen this problem first hand at SFGH and then you decided to conduct some research into an intervention I believe into how this cycle might be stopped
    - Lieberman The two latest articles documenting the efficacy if the treatment we developed have been published in the Journal of American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in and
    - Miller Why dont you describe the first study and then the follow up
    - Lieberman The first study showed that when we intervene with preschoolers and their battered mothers by focusing on the relationship between mother and child not only the children improve on their behavioral problems and the incidents and intensity of posttraumatic stress disorder but the their mothers have much better scores in measure of depression anxiety and posttraumatic stress And the conclusion we dried from this is that focusing on their relationship benefits not only the child but the mother as well relative to the intervention in the comparison group that was directed individually to the child and individually to the mother Our conclusion again is that relationships are very important in the first years of life and that is where the focus of the intervention should be
    - Miller Can you describe the type of sessions that would go on between the mother and child what was actually happening between them
    - Lieberman The sessions took place either in the home or in a playroom here in our offices and we would bring the mother and the child together and sit on the floor and play Through the play children invariably reenacted the violence that they witnessed
    - Miller How would they do so
    - Lieberman For example they would have the father figure beat up the mother figure when they were playing with dolls they would have a little child doll scream Help Help they would have dinosaurs scoop down and eat up all the baby animals in sight and sometimes they disrupted their play and became aggressive themselves
    - And when they became aggressive the mothers often responded by saying you are just like your father and this kind of exchange led us to start reflecting with the mother and the child about the difficult circumstances theyd gone through
    - Miller So the discussion of these circumstances was that enough Or where there actual tactics and strategies the mother is left with at the end of the session about how to cope better or what
    - Lieberman It depended a lot on the mothers own capacity and creativity to come up with her own resources Some mothers had a hard experience watching their children enact the violence they witnessed and they said I had never realized that my child was so frightened I never realized they even witnessed it
    - Miller And how old were these children
    - Lieberman Three to five years old for the randomized study but weve also done studies with children one and two years of age And had very similar results
    - Miller How quickly into these sessions would the children start reenacting these violent moments in the home
    - Lieberman Individual differences are really very pervasive and some children started enacting the violence in the waiting room other children never enacted the violence because they responded to the violence by becoming very withdrawn sad and lethargic And so for those children we actually needed to have an alternative tact which was to entice them to become more expressive of their feelings and what they enacted was fear rather than aggression in their play
    - So the treatment we developed is very individually tailored to how the parent and the child experienced their situation
    - Miller So there was this period of these sessions that concluded and then I believe you did a followup study to see if the benefits persisted and what were your findings in that study
    - Lieberman The findings persisted for the children and the mothers continued to improve six moths after followup without treatment relative to the control group So that the mothers in the treatment group receiving the relationship based intervention were actually less depressed less anxious relative to how they were at the end of treatment
    - And we believe this has to do with improvement with the relationship with their children and with the fact that their children were so improved that they became easier to deal with and more pleasurable in everyday interaction And we know that mothers derive a great deal of their own selfesteem from their sense of how good they are as mothers So we believe them feeling that theyre better mothers with healthier children enabled them to improve in their individual mental health as well
    - Miller Can we assume that the economic circumstances or the violence in the home has not changed because those circumstances might be beyond the control of the mother and child correct
    - Lieberman Absolutely We did the study with women who had chosen to leave the violent relationship because we believe that ongoing violence is a major obstacle against improvement as a result of treatment And we wanted to see weather we could assuage the longterm consequences of exposure to violence rather than work with ongoing violence
    - Miller So these women had made a commitment to change their lives before they even agreed to participate in the program
    - Lieberman Correct One of the good findings of the study is that the mothers tended not to return to their violent relationships both in intervention and in the control group and remember the control group also had intervention And this in turn taught us that providing a safe place for mothers to be supported helps them not to return to violent relationships In general the data shows many many women return to violent relationships when they do not have alternative sources of support
    - Miller Well I know you have become an expert in his area and you have a long association with an organization called Zero to Three Id like to talk to you about that for a minute and then explain the relationship with that organization to your recent presentation to a session in Seattle with the Dali Lama
    - Lieberman Zero to Three is the national center for infants daughters and families it is an organization that is based in Washington DC and it has the goal of improving the expertise both in intervention and in public policy towards the wellbeing of children in the birth to three age range And they have a policy center that advocates in congress for public polices that will benefit young children You have to remember the systems that are in place to help underserved children in need are not up to scale For example only three percent of eligible children are enrolled in early head Start and only of eligible children are enrolled in Head Start in site of research evidence showing that these are very good programs to improve childrens cognitive and social development and so its a very important organization on behalf of children
    - Miller And your relationship with that organization and membership on the board actually led to an invitation to the Seattle meeting no
    - Lieberman The invitation to the Seattle meeting actually came through the organizers knowledge of my research and clinical activities
    - Miller So you went to the meeting in Seattle and were actually able to make a presentation
    - Lieberman I had the honor of being in a panel with the Dali Lama called Seeds of Compassion which is the name of the organization The Dali Lama is very interested in learning how science influences knowledge of spiritual pursuits and he has been known to say that if something in Buddhism is not scientifically correct it should be discarded from the religion
    - He was very interested in learning about the early origins of compassion We had a panel where we talked to him about the data showing that babies from the first minutes after birth are able to relate to people respond to facial expressions able to imitate facial expressions and are soothed differentially by contact with mother versus contact with others
    - In that context I was able to talk to the Dali Lama and to the audience of about eight thousand about the impact of domestic violence on young childrens physical development and emotional health
    - Miller And what do you feel was the outcome of that encounter both for you perhaps and maybe for the listeners
    - Lieberman Ive been receiving a lot of emails from people who attended the conference saying that they had not realized very young children are aware of fights between their parents and are frightened by those fights they said that they thought children did not become aware of violence until or years of age and able to speak about it and the Dali Lama said he thought the experience of violence begins in the womb And I think that is a reflection of his wisdom
    - Miller Well you certainly have made us wiser thank you so much for joining me on Science Caf
    - Lieberman Thank you very much

    - Its fun and sometimes useful to think of the human brain as a supple and wonderful computer But that would be doing a disservice to our brain
    - As UCSF neuroscientist Michael Stryker PhD reminds us computers dont work unless they have all their components in place Human brains on the other hand must both work and grow simultaneously an ingenious strategy that has resulted in a juicedup neocortex proportionately larger than those of all other animals on the planet

    - Its fun and sometimes useful to think of the human brain as a supple and wonderful computer But that would be doing a disservice to our brain
    - As UCSF neuroscientist Michael Stryker PhD reminds us computers dont work unless they have all their components in place Human brains on the other hand must both work and grow simultaneously an ingenious strategy that has resulted in a juicedup neocortex proportionately larger than those of all other animals on the planet

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf today Im with Michael Stryker a professor of physiology and a member of the Keck Center for integrative neuroscience at UCSF welcome Michael
    - Michael Stryker Welcome To my office laughter
    - Miller Id like to start out by asking you what do you think the is the role for science in our society
    - Stryker I think science is the basic knowledge that allows technological advances that have made our society so much more healthy than we were hundreds of years ago and I think really the most significant cultural accomplishments of the last hundred years are scientific you can point to earlier times in history when the real creations were what we think as artistic renaissance art in Italy and so on but the progress of science now is the increase in human understanding that really is a significant event in human culture We actually appreciate how many things work that were just an utter mystery before
    - So I think the role in science is in part a demonstration of human capacity to create things Science is creating stories about how the world works And the difference between scientific stories and other stories is that scientific stories are correct laughter so they not only have consequences for action in the world like new toys new devices better food production but they also have consequences for thinking about ourselves in relation to the universe and appreciating that things dont just happen they happen for a reason they have causes and the human mind can understand those things
    - Miller So theres this intellectual side but theres also practicalprosperity security health all that
    - Stryker Yes And its difficult when we live sometimes with political leadership that isnt based in reality in the hope that wishful thinking will make it so is contrary to the way science works And so I think science is the ultimate realitybased policy is what science is for Its quite different from the faithbased policy which were seen in a lot of our political leadership recently where they believe that actions dont really have predictable consequences
    - Miller What would you say is the state of science in society today
    - Stryker It depends over what time period youre talking about but if you think it over the decades I think science is really vibrant and healthy its very very exciting to be doing science now particularly to be doing biology and neuroscience where were really beginning to figure out how things work in a way that was inconceivable when I was a grad student so I think science basically is very healthy I think there are threats to it Theres a knownothing political threat that may in the long run pose a problem and of course in the last few years theres been a very serious threat to the integrity of science in the United States because of reductions in real levels of funding
    - Miller You mentioned money there when I think of money I think of graduate training the infrastructure of science and I read something recently about whats called the PostScience Era which is applying a business model to this infrastructure of discovery and saying essentially that America does not necessarily have to invest in this infrastructure this educational infrastructure that has graduate students learning things in labs that in fact if its cheaper to do that elsewhere its better for the US to exploit the discoveries that others make and not bother spending public money on this now what do you feel about that
    - Stryker I think thats a really foolish idea that the US by virtue of having a really superior method for supporting science and for giving independence for young scientists to pursue their dreams has been a tremendous beneficiary of scientific talent from all over the world From Europe from Russia from China from elsewhere and from many parts of the much less developed world from India theres been a tremendous brain drain of people in whom those countries invest a great deal in training them and many of the most talented ones come to the US and stay here and I think are responsible for much of the vibrant science in this country and for much of our progress in technology California benefited enormously early on by having the best public university system in the world And for California taking out of state students to train for an education isnt a burden its an investment because the people who come from out of state and get educated here then stay here and start companies and create the modern economy in California So its certainly the case that you can profit from discoveries made elsewhere and I think in the course of this debate there are a number of examples that have been pointed out advances in semi conductors recent advances in light emitting diodes that were done in laboratories in Japan that are being exploited economically in the US and there are lots of examples from Europe where our industry is benefiting from discoveries made elsewhere but that wouldnt happen if we didnt have the whole infrastructure of discovery and innovation and technology and business coming together and it comes together around the great universities
    - Miller Well the brain also comes together in a wiring sort of way so Im wondering if you could explain to the listeners the nature of your research and just give us an overview of what you understand as to the wiring system that takes shape in the brain during the developmental stages which is sort of the center piece of your research effort at UCSF
    - Stryker Well its an amazing thing the brain has zillions and zillions of neurons and it only works because theyre connected together in the right way each neuron talks to the right other neurons and tells them something and other neurons process the information further and end up allowing us to make decisions and do actions And the subject I work on is how these correct connections get formed and we work on it in a very early stage of the highest part of the brain the neocortex the part thats really big in human beings compared to other animals and its the part of the brain we think with a lot of our conscious experience perhaps all of it
    - Miller This is the part that developed within the last hundred thousand years or so I know theres debate about that but
    - Stryker Yeah theres debate about that but Neanderthal man had a pretty big cortex and modern man has an even bigger one But basically very very smart mammals have bigger cortices The neo cortex has existed for a very long time but its much much bigger in relation to the rest of the brain in us
    - Miller Can we anticipate that it will continue to grow over the eons
    - Stryker I dont know I think its a really interesting question whether evolution is frozen or whether its continuing I dont have any wellinformed opinion on it
    - Miller Im going to take you down a side road here because it occurred to me if the brain increased in size I guess that would be in some ways determined by the size of the birth canal in females so
    - Stryker Maybe although you could imagine having smaller neurons that grow bigger post natal than there is now I dont see any reason in principle that couldnt happen The real question is whether cultural issues I mean human culture and human civilization have changed the selective pressure that gave rise thru evolution by natural selection to larger and larger brains in the hominids and the monkeys the prehuman apes that had smaller brains that presumable evolved into humans that I believe and I dont think anyone really knows the details I mean Im convinced that no one knows the details that was presumably due to the advantage of human intelligence in insuring survival And making it more likely that the offspring of intelligent parents would be more likely to survive and those intelligent parents had bigger brains
    - But it may well be those cultural factors the way civilization works now were not actually selecting for people to be more intelligent its very hard to know these are very vague issues and in the time horizon of any individual human being they have no impact laughter So theyre not issues that I can make myself care about
    - Miller OK Im going to circle you back to the main road now so we have this brain taking shape this wiring being laid down and it has to be very specific
    - Stryker Right And so its specific in large part because theyre a number of different cell types in the brain and those cell types have chemical signals on them that allow them to recognize other cell types But the question of how the whole brain gets set up its a complicated set of instructions that these cells have about where they should grow who they should connect to and how they do it And we know that there are a number of different signals involved and we know some of the details about these signals because we study mice in which one of the molecules that is part of one of these signaling systems is defective and we see that the brain gets miswired in different ways
    - But the striking thing about the brain as say compared to a computer which has to be wired up correctly is the brain has to be useful during the time its wired it isnt put together in a factory while its not working and then the good ones are selected and the bad ones are thrown away instead the brain starts functioning at a much simpler level and the neurons grow and make more and more connections during our life as a fetus and during our early postnatal life and it takes quite a while for the brain to get wired up properly
    - Miller How long Three years four years
    - Stryker Well in the parts of the brain I study it clearly takes throughout fetal life and throughout the first year and a half or so with development preceding very very rapidly in the first six weeks or so after birth So thats a period of time when we know from animal models that the connections are being formed in a preliminary way and then those preliminary connections are being refined during normal development And theyre being refined by two different kinds of signals and weve actually studied this in mice where the corresponding period of time is the first few weeks of life

    - This is the end My only friend the end
    - The Doors Jim Morrison wasnt thinking about UCSF medical anthropologist Sharon Kaufman PhD when he wrote those lyrics more than years ago But Kaufman the author of three books and dozens of articles on how modern medicine organizes itself around the big issues of aging life and death could make it her anthem that is if she had time to sing
    - As it is this selfdescribed cartographer of lifes loose ends has made dying and death and the medical systems organized around these events her fulltime passion In doing so she has become both a researcher and a provocateur of the wards asking questions of and following around nurses doctors social workers patients families and others in pursuit of the truth
    - And what is that truth First be prepared Kaufman says to baby boomers the first of whom turn in Talk to family members and close friends about how you see the end of life Get real about aging too she adds Philosophizing over a glass of wine is not the same as being armed with the facts The reason Unless someone says Stop to all the medical intervention that prolongs life which she reminds us is what our medical system is supposed to do you might end up prolonging death instead
    - Indeed Kaufman turns an unflattering light on the gray zone Americans choose to ignore In this gray zone patients on feeding tubes and ventilators supported by an expert care system and a network of nursing homes and special hospitallike facilities live on in a twilight that can last as long as years It is death brought to life she says and an end that will inevitably ensnare the unaware

    - Anyone who has ever suffered from an intractable headache can understand why the ancients used to remove segments of the skull to let the evil spirits and the bad vapors escape We dont know of course whether trepanation as this form of surgery is called actually worked But the desperate maneuver underlines the suffering of the victim
    - Peter Goadsby
    - Neurologist Peter Goadsby MD PhD director of UCSFs Headache Center and a world expert on this common and often debilitating ailment knows your pain He sees it every day sometimes in children as young as years old Worse he sees the unnecessary frustration of patients who have endured misdiagnoses and missed opportunities for relief
    - Indeed if there is any single message Goadsby wants to trumpet it is hope hope that the brain imaging of headaches as they occur will lead to better therapies hope that the right diagnosis can lead to interventions that offer some relief and hope that regular routines an eveningout of the ups and downs we all experience can defuse the power of various headache triggers like bright light noise and stress
    - For all his compassion though Goadsby has no time for what he considers foolish North American assumptions that many types of food are primary headache fodder nitrateladen hot dogs being the one obvious exception Part of beating headaches he insists is knowing the truth about them

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to a special edition of Science Caf todays conversation with famed expert Peter Goadsby director of UCSFs Headache Center begins with a question do headaches serve some evolutionary purpose
    - Peter Goadsby Theres no evolutionary purpose we can see for the primary headaches and let me make the distinction that there are two types of headaches broadly there are those called primary headaches where headache where headache is the disorder migraines would be a great example of that and there are secondary headaches where the headache is due to some thing happening like an infection or a bleed or a tumor
    - I can understand why getting a warning about an infection or a tumor growing in the head is a good thing I can see a benefit to that but for the primary headaches its very difficult to understand what is attractive about having one in three adult western females stricken by migraine
    - Miller Is there anyone in the world who has probably not experienced a headache do you suppose
    - Goadsby There are two sorts of people there are those who have primary headaches and have them relatively frequently in varying severities and there are a small group of people who never seem to have a headache they seem to be very lucky
    - Miller Truly there is a small group that never has a headache
    - Goadsby Yes theres a small group of people who will tell you that they more of less never have headaches
    - Miller Do you suffer from headaches yourself
    - Goadsby No
    - Miller Anyone close to you
    - Goadsby Oh yes
    - Miller Was that the prompt to get into this field of study or was it some other reason
    - Goadsby The prompt to get into headaches was a lecture that my mentor gave many years ago about migraines I found the explanation unsatisfactory and it was the first thing in the medical school curriculum that ever struck me as interesting and Ive been interested in it ever since
    - Miller What would you list as some of the common causes you mentioned structural damage and the like that causes pain but the other kinds of headaches stress food allergies lack of sleep what would be other things on the list maybe
    - Goadsby All things you describe pretty much are migraine triggers The commonest form of disabling or troublesome headaches in the Western world is migraine Now many migraine sufferers think that what they have is normal because migraine is substantially inherited and in their families it is indeed normal So the typical migraine sufferer will have headache triggered by change change in sleeping habits eating habits change in the weather change in levels of stress too much or too little stress and some particular triggers like alcohol Many migraners think of all that as just normality and it is for them but in reality most of that is migraine
    - Miller So how about this classification of sinus headache cluster headache menstrual headaches therere all different types correct or are they all triggering the same mechanism
    - Goadsby Those headaches have distinctions Cluster headache is a particular type of primary headache it mainly affects men and of all the cluster patients Ive ever seen it is the most severe form of pain known to man or woman You mentioned sinus headache sinus headache is vastly over diagnosed in North America largely because some of the symptoms that occur in migraines such as eye watering or nasal stuffiness redness or irritation around the eyes and nose can occur in migraine and occur in sinus headaches Menstural headaches or almost invariably menstrually triggered migraine
    - Miller And how about a class of headache I learned about fairly recently the pressure headache the one caused by intracranial hypertension Is that often overlooked do you suppose
    - Goadsby There is a class of headache associated with either increases or decreases in intracranial pressure its one of the socalled secondary headaches because theres a cause thats clearly identified I think its like most forms of headache struggles to get diagnosed although in terms of commonness its nothing like migraine
    - Miller You mentioned severity of pain earlier with the cluster headaches how do you rate this obviously pain is a subjective experience youre not experiencing it as a clinician or researcher so how is this classified and how do you know where it falls on the gauge of pain
    - Goadsby I think the most useful gauge of pain is the degree of disability that the problem affords so if you have an attack of migraine for example you cant get out of bed or you cant get to work or you cant take the kids to school you cant fulfill social obligations you cant do anything then youre highly disabled It really doesnt matter what the level of pain is in some abstract sense because as you say its a highly individual thing
    - Whats crucial is the impact of the headache on a persons life When you take a productive young well person who is stricken for a day thats a very severe illness And the disability is the big measure of that
    - Miller What is your research revealing at this point
    - Goadsby We have a broad research program weve set up here at UCSF with fundamental research looking at the mechanisms of actions of drugs and the development of new medicines in the treatment of migraines We have a strong component of brain imaging where were interested in trying to see whats happening in migraine and cluster headache in the human brain during the attacks and thats probably been the most exciting thing weve been doing in the last few years back in London and begun to do here because it actually gives us a window onto these attacks which otherwise one couldnt see
    - And the third leg to our stool is clinical care Its terribly important to evolve a really high quality clinical program both with inpatients and outpatients so that we can really look after all the people who come along with disabling and troublesome headaches
    - Miller So is the ultimate goal better drugs or some other kind of therapy
    - Goadsby Our mission statement is to make the world a better place for people with primary headache disorders Were going to do that by increasing understanding which is probably the most crucial thing that we could leave to our children a better understanding of the disorder In the short term certainly Id like to be involved in meds and development and I have been involved in meds and development but if I leave one thing behind Id like to leave behind a world that treated people with headache problems much better than it currently does
    - Miller Do headaches increase with age
    - Goadsby In general terms no most headaches get better with age certainly migraine gets better around the time of the mid to late s A terrible thing about the disorder is it really strikes down people in their young and productive years
    - Miller What is the worst case youve ever seen personally
    - Goadsby Im sad to say I have seen dozens of worst cases I have seen yearolds with dreadful headache problems that have been attributed simply to school avoidance and silly ideas like that Ive seen adolescents have their entire lifes preparation ruined Ive seen young mothers who couldnt look after their children and Ive seen people who run oil companies who could buy the building were sitting in and cant buy themselves a decent day without disabling headaches These disorders dont respect age social economic status what they do is strike down people over a range of our society
    - Miller So when they come to the UICSF Headache Clinic what can you actually do for them
    - Goadsby The first and most crucial thing to do for someone with a headache problem is to make sure to get the diagnosis right A proportion of people we see simply the diagnosis was wrong and if you dont know where youre going youll always be lost sop thats the first thing I can do We can make sure the patient understands their disorder as best we can with the current information so that they can take some control of the problem for themselves and then we can optimize the management of their problem through nonpharmaceutical approaches or through pharmaceutical approaches
    - Miller Is there any advice you have for people who suffer from headaches that are not the totally debilitating kind some foods to avoid of things they can do and in answering that inevitably the question comes up about things like acupressure etc are they of any value
    - Goadsby The first piece of advice Id give to anyone with headaches is dont give up dont think theres nothing that can be done because theres almost no one for which nothing can be done The second piece of advice and this is good general advice for migrainers is to try to even your life out Regular sleep regular exercise regular meals a bit of regular grief not too much and not too little Regularity will help you a great deal Theres not much to be made of this food myth so to speak Alcohol and perversely hot dogs which is less of a problem in most of the world but is a funny problem here Theres a little bit of the nitrate problem in many types of hot dogs and that produces a little bit of an issue for migrainers so the main thing I say to migrainers is just get some regularity give yourself some time in your life dont give the time to everyone else around you as generous as you might want to be and try to even the highs and the lows out thats generally good advice
    - You mentioned acupressure and acupuncture I think the substantial benefit of those types of therapies is around giving time to the individual theyre almost like relaxation therapies Its been reasonably clearly shown for example in acupuncture that it doesnt matter where in the head you stick the needle so long as you stick a needle in the head so the idea that there are traditional points where the acupuncture should be done doesnt stand up to any analytical basis The problem with those types of therapies is what is consistent with the idea that theyre related to simply broadly speaking taking time for yourself and getting some level of relaxation reduced stress is that when you stop doing them theres no carryover effect
    - Miller Last question how many patients are you seeing now at the Headache Clinic here at UCSF
    - Goadsby We see a large number of patients at the clinic every week have quite an active clinical program but were still building up and happy to see more
    - Miller Okay thankfully Im not one of those people Peter thank you for joining me on Science caf
    - Goadsby Thank you

    title: "Turning Fat to Muscle: A Conversation with Growth Factor and Cell Differentiation Expert Rik Derynck"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Science thrives on discovery And if you look at the number of papers being published in scientific journals and online not to mention all the scholarly discussion they generate and bloggers they feed discovery is booming
    - Sometimes though the most thoughtprovoking wondrous findings dont penetrate the public consciousness One such body of work has to belong to Rik Derynck PhD codirector of UCSFs Institute for Regeneration Medicine and director of the Program in Craniofacial and Mesenchymal Biology
    - Derynck one of Europes first genetic engineers has built a distinguished UCSF career studying transforming growth factors alpha and beta Over the years Derynck has tracked the role of these growth factors in everything from cancers growth and spread to tissue regeneration cell differentiation and regulation of the immune system
    - Rik Derynck
    - At the same time he has zeroed in on socalled mesenchymal cells a class of adult stem cells that differentiate thanks to the influence of transforming growth factors into fat bone muscle cartilage and connective tissue
    - Think about this for a moment Fat and muscle bone and fat muscle and cartilage they all start with the same kind of cell Knowing how to control the signals that lead to each kind of tissue opens the door to all sorts of exciting possibilities Derynck and his colleagues have come close to not only opening that door but knocking it down Indeed a number of successful experiments in the last decade have conjured what Derynck calls his dream scenarios
    - Imagine for example being able to extract prefat cells through liposuction modify them slightly and then use them in patients suffering from degenerative diseases to develop new muscle or bone As for the more commercial potential well consider what would happen in todays America if there were a cosmetic treatment that could turn fat cells into muscle
    - It sounds farfetched now but Derynck predicts that therapeutic uses will be a reality within a decade The same is true of new treatments to block the spread of cancer If so the sound of joy will then be too loud to miss

    title: Spinal Cord Repair:&nbsp; A Conversation with Jacqueline Bresnahan and Michael Beattie
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - In humanitys universe of greatest fears spinal cord injury and paralysis play the part of the giant asteroid that crashes into Earth Nothing is ever the same again
    - Jacqueline Bresnahan PhD and Michael Beattie PhD lead investigators in UCSFs Brain and Spinal Injury Center might not be able to save this world But as spinal cord experts with a combined years of research experience they hope to be able one day to repair it
    - Ironically it is the bodys own attempt to heal itself that worsens spinal cord injury Despite popular belief the husbandandwife team explains few patients truly suffer a severed spinal cord Damage comes instead from the crushing of the vertebrae and the severe bruising that quiets the signals between the nerve cells and the brain
    - As axons try to recover and reconnect the body mounts an inflammatory response generating scar tissue that blocks the restoration process Indeed except in the most extreme cases some function persists immediately after injury Saving some nerve function might not prevent paralysis But it could limit paralysis dramatically improving the quality of life as a consequence
    - This is why Bresnahan and Beatties presence at San Francisco General Hospital SFGH which boasts one of the nations premier trauma centers is critical to their translational research SFGH is where some of the nations thousands of car crash sports injury and other patients with spinal cord injuries arrive first And it is there that multidisciplinary teams work feverishly to stabilize patients and arrest what Beattie calls the death of neurons
    - Progress has been slow But as their work continues and as the explosion of knowledge in cell and molecular biology lights up the darkness Bresnahan and Beattie see a different future one where initial damage is controlled and where those living with spinal cord injury regain function thanks to stem cell transplants
    - Pie in the sky Well tell that to the hundreds of thousands in America alone who must live with their injury every day They might not be able to turn back the clock but they are certainly rooting for Bresnahan and Beattie to reset it

    - Watching a dancer leap a soccer player dribble or a pianist seduce sound from a keyboard reminds us of the powerful and graceful movements a trained and talented body can achieve But while we admire what we see while we marvel at the controlled contortions of arms fingers and legs it is what we dont see the command centers of the brain that is due the homage
    - UCSFs Anatol Kreitzer PhD assistant investigator at the UCSFaffiliated Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease and one of the Pew Charitable Trusts most promising young scientists for has kept the brain in mind ever since he made the switch from linguistics to neuroscience late in his undergraduate career
    - Movement has become his cause
    - Like everything else that seems so simple movement is complex What we do and see others do from speaking to sprinting is the end result of a sequence of events that begin deep inside different brain pathways
    - One such pathway originates in the brain structure called the basal ganglia where as Kreitzer explains motor planning takes place
    - For Parkinsons patients though the basal ganglia stripped of the neurotransmitter dopamine that keeps neurons working normally cannot plan let alone execute along a pathway In the end stages of the disease patients are as Kreitzer says extremely immobile
    - Exploring why this happens and searching for ways around the problem led Kreitzer and his colleagues to a class of chemicals called cannabinoids which break down when the flow of dopamine drops Using mice models of Parkinsons disease Kreitzer was able to transform formerly immobile mice into hyperactive harriers at least until the drug that blocked the breakdown of cannabinoids wore off
    - Its a big step from mice to humans of course but in isolating a treatment mechanism Kreitzer has now vaulted into the limelight

    - As promised the full video highlights of the Gladstone Institutes July science sampler for high school students are now available below The Gladstone has made a cultural virtue of outreach believing that the public understanding of science as well as our future supply of scientists requires special attention Public support for science built on a foundation of science literacy is a critical part of that equation as well
    - In the months ahead we hope to expand our Science Caf video offerings with this literacy in mind We also plan to deploy an index of the various topics technologies diseases and conditions and scientists that have become part of the Science Caf network

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf Today were at the UCSFaffiliated Gladstone Institutes which are just across the street from UCSFs Mission Bay campus Why are we here Well you might ask the same question of the high school studentspart of the National Student Leadership Conferencewhove come to learn how Gladstone scientists are working to solve the problems of human disease
    - Lets go inside and check it out
    - Robert W Mahley MD PhD President J David Gladstone Institutes As you go through the day youre going to learn that the Gladstone doctors and scientists focus on three of the most important diseases facing humankind today One of those is heart disease which is the leading cause of death in almost all countries today around the world
    - A second area where our investigators spend considerable effort in science is in AIDS and the HIV epidemic There are now more than million people who have died from AIDS and we are not close to stemming this epidemic around the world
    - The third area of research that youll hear about today is Alzheimers Disease and other brain disorders Alzheimers is one of the fastest growing diseases that robs us of our memories that is going on at present day
    - But were very pleased to have this group here again today to consider the possibility of a career in science in medicine in healthcare Personally Ive been involved in medicine and science now for almost years and I can tell you today is as exciting a day as when I began my career I cant imagine a more exciting and more rewarding career and I challenge you to consider this for your own lives
    - Miller voiceover Students agreed that science was both a worthy cause and a fulfilling career when they werent hurrying around to their next session
    - Miller to a student Do you consider yourself a future scientist
    - Student I do consider myself a future scientist Im majoring in human biology so I hope to pursue a career in the medicine field
    - Miller to another student Are you considering a scientific career
    - Student Oh yeah
    - Miller Any particular field
    - Student I want to go into neurology
    - Miller Why neurology
    - Student Really two reasons Im interested in how the brain functions and its also a personal reason Ive had family members whove had brain tumors and have passed away from that
    - Miller to another student Are you interested in a scientific career
    - Student Oh yeah definitely
    - Miller What kind
    - Student Probably medicine infectious diseases
    - Miller You want to work at a place like the Gladstone someday or UCSF
    - Student Yeah Yeah I want to do a lot of research
    - Miller voiceover For some students though future careers were a little more uncertain although science was definitely in the mix
    - Miller to another student Where are you from
    - Student Portland Oregon
    - Miller So do you consider yourself a future scientist
    - Miller Is there anything particular youve learned about science today that might have changed your mind or made you more interested in the field
    - Student Well I think the research is really interesting so yeah
    - Miller to another student So do you see yourself working at a place like the Gladstone at some point in the future
    - Student I would love to work in a place like this but Im also interested in medicine so I want to be able to do clinical and research at the same time
    - Miller So be like an MDPhDtype person
    - Student Im thinking about it I cant say for certain but Im still thinking about it
    - Miller Do you know how long that takes to get an MDPhD
    - Student laughing A long time from what my friend told me
    - Miller I think it can take as long as years sometimes
    - Student Hmmm laughing now thats going to steer me away from it
    - Miller voiceover To help inspire these wouldbe future scientists Gladstone Institute researchers narrated tales from the front lines of virology neurology and cardiology Subject areas included Alzheimers Disease stem cells and HIVAIDS
    - Warner Greene MD PhD Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology So every day people become infected with this virus Every day people die as a result of AIDS percent of these infections are occurring in the developing world areas of the world that are least able to deal with the onslaught of this virus Over half of the infections are occurring in young adults individuals your age between and years old And unfortunately only in people who are infected know that they are infected and as such theyre at greater risk to spread the virus to other individuals Tragically children are infected every day largely as a result of mothertochild transmission of the virus and in fact we now have ready approaches for stopping that vertical transmission of the virus yet these therapies are not widely available in the parts of the world where the virus is spreading most rapidly And then a notoften appreciated consequence of this global pandemic is the fact that more than million children have been orphaned due to the death of one or both of their parents by HIVAIDS
    - Miller voiceover One of the highlights of Jennifer Ngs stem cell talk was a short video of beating heart cells glowing green which were originally derived from embryonic stem cells Real beating hearts this time from chick embryos were also the topic of the day at the animal models of heart development demonstration which was just one of ten handson demonstrations on everything from experimental methods for studying Parkinsons Disease to DNA microarrays
    - Did any of it sink in Were brain fires stoked
    - Student to Miller Well actually my last year I did a paper in stem cells and Im just learning that theres not a sufficient amount of government funding for the arena right now handicapping the scientists So developments really cant be made without sufficient lines of stem cells or the government funding
    - Student to Miller In one of the lectures I learned about AIDS and HIV and then Alzheimers and over here they had a bunch of different embryos and new technology to show how almost like an MRI to take photos from different angles and then it can create a D image of the heart And then you can take a normal heart and look at it and then an abnormal heart and find whats wrong with it without opening the embryo
    - Student to Miller I just thought it was interesting because my research is in Parkinsons Disease and how its related with Alzheimers Especially with lots of animal models that were doing its very similar
    - Student to Miller Oh well Ive learned a lot about how they use embryos of chicks and mice to research stem cells and how stem cells can be formed to create new cells to create an organ like the heart
    - Miller to a group of three students So you guys have seen a couple of sessions already So what has been the most intriguing thing youve learned so far Who wants to go first
    - pause
    - Student I dont know Just being able to see what a medical career would be like and different options that youd have
    - Miller Did you consider a scientific career before coming today
    - Student Yes Im actually thinking of being a pediatrician
    - Miller to second student in group And how about you
    - Student I like going to labs to get to see what theyre experimenting on and the future technology
    - Miller So had you considered a scientific career before today
    - Student Yes I want to be an oncologist
    - Miller to third student in group And how about you
    - Student I think my favorite thing was just seeing all the advancements that are going on here in the lab and in other parts of the country and seeing how humans are helping other humans
    - Miller Have you been to the stem cell session yet
    - Student Yes
    - Miller OK Can you tell me what a stem cell is
    - Student Its a cell that divides and Im forgetting something
    - Student Its found in the blastocytescysts
    - Student Its pluripotent so it can divide into any other kind of cell
    - Miller Excellent You guys have listened well Thank you so much

    - Its a heady moment when you take on evolution and come out a winner But that is exactly how translational neuroscientist Krys Bankiewicz MD PhD feels these days
    - Bankiewicz you see has devised a method for delivering drugs directly to specific areas in the brain and imaging the results to ensure success Doing so has allowed him to circumvent evolutions bloodbrain barrier which while designed to block poisons from flooding the brain also prevents helpful drugs from doing much good either
    - Krys Bankiewicz
    - For Parkinsons disease patients this could mean using engineered viruses to deliver the missing neurotransmitter dopamine and small molecules to bring growth factor to dying cells For brain cancer patients it could mean a timereleased system that lasts for months killing tumor cells as they arise
    - If all this sounds farfetched dont tell it to some dog owners whose pets were near death from brain cancer Thanks to Bankiewiczs drug infusion system being used by veterinarians in a special project at the University of California Davis a high percentage of the dogs have now lived for years instead of months
    - Bankiewicz describes this march across the valley of death from basic science to clinical reality as both his passion and his calling The brain is not an organ as much as organism he says And in respecting its function as a universe unto itself Bankiewicz might just have become its newest star

    title: "A Virus Virtuoso: A Conversation with Molecular Biologist Joe DeRisi"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - UCSFs Joe DeRisi PhD gives science a good name A relaxed California native MacArthur Foundation Fellow and imaginative thinker DeRisi is wellknown for being approachable collaborative smart and easy to like
    - So is his science which concentrates on finding clues to and cures for infectious diseases
    - DeRisi burst onto the public scene in when together with postdoctoral fellow David Wang PhD and UCSF virologist Don Ganem MD he used microarray technology to detect the SARS virus within hours of receiving it from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The team also classified and genetically defined the virus in quick order
    - What became known as the ViroChip a microarray that contains DNA from every known virus a number that now approaches was used two years later to identify an unknown virus in human prostate tumors
    - That same DeRisiandGanem team has now found a virus associated with an infectious disease that has been killing parrots and other exotic birds for more than years Better yet they have developed a diagnostic test so that healthy birds including some endangered species can be protected from sick ones checking the spread of what is known as PDD proventricular dilatation disease
    - Such results might be enough for any other scientist but DeRisis ViroChip work represents only half of his labs activity The rest of his interdisciplinary team is dedicated to discovering weak links in the life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum The goal to identify drug or vaccine targets that could help reduce the annual malaria death toll which ranges from to nearly million Many of the victims are children under the age of
    - When DeRisi speaks of this human toll and the comparative dearth of scientists studying ways to combat malaria he shakes his head in dismay But he does not belabor the gesture There is too much work left to do too many viruses yet to discover too much curiosity to sate And as he knows and accepts the public is waiting He does not plan to keep them waiting long

    title: "A Virus Virtuoso: A Conversation with Molecular Biologist Joe DeRisi"
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - UCSFs Joe DeRisi PhD gives science a good name A relaxed California native MacArthur Foundation Fellow and imaginative thinker DeRisi is wellknown for being approachable collaborative smart and easy to like
    - So is his science which concentrates on finding clues to and cures for infectious diseases
    - DeRisi burst onto the public scene in when together with postdoctoral fellow David Wang PhD and UCSF virologist Don Ganem MD he used microarray technology to detect the SARS virus within hours of receiving it from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The team also classified and genetically defined the virus in quick order
    - What became known as the ViroChip a microarray that contains DNA from every known virus a number that now approaches was used two years later to identify an unknown virus in human prostate tumors
    - That same DeRisiandGanem team has now found a virus associated with an infectious disease that has been killing parrots and other exotic birds for more than years Better yet they have developed a diagnostic test so that healthy birds including some endangered species can be protected from sick ones checking the spread of what is known as PDD proventricular dilatation disease
    - Such results might be enough for any other scientist but DeRisis ViroChip work represents only half of his labs activity The rest of his interdisciplinary team is dedicated to discovering weak links in the life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum The goal to identify drug or vaccine targets that could help reduce the annual malaria death toll which ranges from to nearly million Many of the victims are children under the age of
    - When DeRisi speaks of this human toll and the comparative dearth of scientists studying ways to combat malaria he shakes his head in dismay But he does not belabor the gesture There is too much work left to do too many viruses yet to discover too much curiosity to sate And as he knows and accepts the public is waiting He does not plan to keep them waiting long

    - Jeff Miller Hello Im Jeff Miller and welcome to Science Caf Today Im with Joe DeRisi a Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator welcome Joe
    - Joe DeRisi Hi Jeff great to be here
    - Miller I think its safe to call you a virus hunter and developer of what is known as the virus chip or the ViroChip I know also that you have some exciting news about your latest infectious disease discovery which Id like you to describe and in doing so could you also explain what a virus chip is and how it works
    - DeRisi Sure So my lab together with Dr Don Ganems lab here at UCSF over the last six years or so have been working on a technology called the virus chip Virus Chip is simply a diagnostic assay in which were able to test for the presence of literally every virus thats ever been discovered
    - Miller How many would that be just out of curiosity
    - DeRisi Well its hard to put a number on the total number of viruses because of all the different mutants and strains and forms But its safe to say we have somewhere on the order of viral sequences on this chip
    - Miller Okay so you can test all at once
    - DeRisi Thats right so were testing for literally thousands of viruses simultaneously instead of the onebyone approach of the past
    - Miller So theres a speed issue and then the comprehensiveness issue So tell me about the latest discovery that you found
    - DeRisi Right
    - Miller which I believe is related to a bird virus
    - DeRisi Thats right And I have to add one more detail to Virus Chip Not only is it capable of detecting the viruses we already know about but to understand this story you have to know that the virus chip is really designed to detect that which weve never seen before And so how can it do that you say Well the chip is basically designed this diagnostic is designed to pick up on the evolutionary the evolutionary conserved bits of the viruses that are preserved throughout time And so certain viruses share little bits of their pieces in common with other viruses And so weve maximized that on our chip So that if there is a new virus and it is related to a known virus we have the chance of picking it up And thats what happened with our most recent discovery
    - Miller So please tell me about that
    - DeRisi Right So for over years theres been a disease that has been killing exotic birds And when I say exotic birds Im really referring to Psittacines these are parrots and cockatoos and parakeets macaws things like this Sometime in the last s macaws were imported from Bolivia into the United States And soon afterwards it was noticed that in many of these birds there was a disease It was then called Macaw Wasting Syndrome in which the birds just stopped eating or couldnt eat That is their whole digestive tract became paralyzed and of course they died The most frightening thing about this was is that this disease then began to spread not from just the macaws that were imported but to all the other birds that theyd been housed with So it was clearly of an infectious nature
    - Miller To all the birds or were there some who seemed impervious to the virus
    - DeRisi Well over different varieties of Psittacines has been documented and when they keep looking they keep finding more
    - Miller Right okay
    - DeRisi No one knows the limit where this virus stops in the order of Psittacine birds But its also been documented in birds outside Psittacines too So its not Id say right now were looking at the tip of the iceberg we dont know actually how many kinds of birds can be infected
    - Miller So what prompted you then to study this particular virus
    - DeRisi Right So no one really actually had evidence that it was a virus
    - Miller Oh okay
    - DeRisi All they had evidence was that it was transmissible and it was likely a virus And all the different characteristics of this disease convinced us that it probably was viral and so thats where the utility of our Virus Chip comes in And so collaborating with two veterinarians one in the US and one in Israel we obtained samples of birds with this disease This disease is called Proventricular Dilation Disease or PDD as its known And so we obtained samples from healthy birds and birds with PDD from two different places in the world This was nice because you want sort of geographically different sources of material so it cant all be biased in one place or another We applied those to our Virus Chip and we saw a striking signature a signature that said that theres likely to be a virus here and its likely to be a Borna virus Youve probably never heard of a Borna virus Borna viruses are viruses that have only previously been known in horses and other kind of livestock And they cause a variety of neurologic symptoms encephalitis and so on in these animals Its ultimately fatal But it also can cause GI dysfunction and paralysis very similar to what we observed in parrots and other exotic birds And so what we had here was evidence of possibly a new avian Borna virus the equivalent of what is in livestock but in birds And itd never been found in birds before And so we then went about cloning the virus from these birds and we were able to recover the complete genome of one of these Borna viruses and pieces of it from many others
    - Miller So is this virus restricted to birds only or can it spread to humans Is there a human counterpart
    - DeRisi There is no evidence at this time that avian Borna virus can be spread to humans Thats an important point because we dont want domestic bird owners to suddenly start throwing their birds onto the street in fear that theyre going to catch a virus Its important to note that theres no evidence right now of transmission to humans And so people should not be afraid of their birds
    - Miller So I want to so bird owners was this virus occurring so frequently and so rapidly that whole populations if you happened to own a bird that you were being made aware of the fact that your bird was at risk and
    - DeRisi So the most frequent problem for domestic bird owner is many bird owners own more than one They might have two or three parrots and they buy or acquire another bird that has PDD they might not know it Because it is quite likely that these birds are shedding virus and are transmitting virus before theyre obviously symptomatic And so when the bird that youve just brought in finally becomes symptomatic its already too late for the other birds in your house Because theyve already acquired it
    - Miller And how long does it normally take for it to show up or
    - DeRisi Highly variable you know its depending on the different kind of bird and theres a lot about the disease we dont know It can be anywhere from months to a couple years And so that thats actually an exciting new area that we can now look into Because previously without any handle on the disease without knowing what causes it those kind of studies were impossible
    - Miller So what does this teach you about viral disease in general perhaps and viruses that do affect humans
    - DeRisi Well its an important lead in what I would call GI tract disorders So there are diseases in humans that are fairly rare that bear some similarity to this and so it does beg the question that could there be viral etiologies of these human disorders And so obviously you want to look at that And humans arent the only ones Theres a wide variety of other animals that also suffer from similar digestive tract abnormalities And those could be also virally caused for all we know This is an important new lead in a whole new area And thats what it really opens up in addition to providing a diagnostic ultimately that allow domestic bird owners aviaries zoos conservatories and bird recovery operations to separate sick from healthy birds
    - Miller Right So itd prevent the spread Now knowing that its a virus does this open the door to some sort of treatment down the road
    - DeRisi Possibly Curing a virus or making a chemotherapeutic or a drug or something to cure a bird of a virus or even a human of a virus is much much harder than simply separating the sick from the healthy So simply by quarantine efforts you may be able to just eliminate the virus For example you know in SARS there is no therapeutic for SARS but by simple quarantine you can stop the spread of the virus Now I think this is an important point to say that we actually dont have concrete proof this virus we found is the causal agent of PDD What we have now is a very strong association between the two and a lot of supporting evidence What will remain to be done is a serious transmission study where we take pure virus and put it into a healthy bird and show whether it gets PDD or not and those experiments are ongoing But its an exciting enough lead that it would be foolish not to act on it now
    - Miller And this is not the first time youve had this sort of undiscovered virus moment was there not a couple of years ago something related to prostate cancer
    - DeRisi Thats right
    - Miller Similar finding right
    - DeRisi Yeah we discovered a novel retrovirus in the prostate tumors of a certain subset of men with a genetic abnormality Thats very interesting and theres a lot of ongoing work on that retrovirus right now as well Again thats another case in which you can find a new virus but youre not actually showing in that discovery that the virus causes cancer Far from it all you know is that its associated So whether its causal or not takes many many years of experiments to figure out
    - Miller So what is your best guess that there are a lot of unknown really viral agents that are responsible for conditions and diseases that we just have not yet connected
    - DeRisi Oh yes by far Just taking cancer for example We know that of all cancers approximately have an infectious etiology whether that be papilloma virus with cervical cancer or human herpes virus with Kaposis Sarcoma or what not we know that a substantial fraction of those are caused by infectious agents Whos to say there isnt a larger slice of that pie that has at its source some infectious cause And thats just cancers There are many many many other diseases for which likely there is an infectious agent but we have not been able to figure it out yet Thats where the Virus Chip technology can have a large part
    - Miller And is that the technology that you developed
    - DeRisi Thats right its Dr Don Ganem and I together over the last six or seven years have been developing the Virus Chip technology
    - Miller And do others the labs around the world now use the same technology
    - DeRisi You know it takes quite a lot of expertise There are several labs out there that are using Virus Chip technologies either to similar or I would say copies of the technology But we published all of our chip technology and what goes into it and how to make it essentially on the web So anybody that reads our papers or comes to our websites can have the entire knowhow to reproduce that technology in their own labs We dont have a company that sells virus chips or anything like that we show people how to do it and expect them to do it on their own
    - Miller Well when they do come to your website they see a lot of information about malaria So tell me about your malaria research and how is that going
    - DeRisi Right So the other half of my lab aside from studying viral etiologies and diseases the other side of my lab studies plasmodium falsiparum Thats the causative agent in the most deadly form of human malaria and so for those who dont know much about malaria it causes somewhere between and deaths per year and half a billion people are sick from it every year Its a massive disease its a giant burden on much of humanity Yet because we dont have malaria in the United States any more its been eradicated from this country and Europe or most of Europe we dont really think about it that much The problem is there was a time when we had really good drugs for malaria and so it was pretty easy to cure But many of those drugs including the cheap ones that of course would be use to many people in the poor world are no longer effective Theres drug resistance thats spread worldwide And to date theres no vaccine with an operational impact against malaria Plenty of vaccines in development but nothing that actually saved anyone
    - Miller So are there enough people studying malaria since its such a huge disease with a huge impact and if there are not would it behoove the scientific community to organize itself in some mammoth effort to fight this disease
    - DeRisi I believe so I dont believe theres enough researchers studying malaria right now Thats a fact Lets just take for example a model organism like bakers yeast Bakers yeast is a classic model organism used biochemistry labs around the country Theres genes in the genome of bakers yeast Theres probably twice that number of labs in the world studying it So if we really wanted to solve bakers yeast wed have two labs per gene everybody gets assigned a gene wed be done with it Thats not how science works Now malaria theres also genes approximately And theres probably only a few hundred labs total in the world working on this And thats pretty sad considering the burden to humanity that malaria really is
    - Miller So are you collaborating with some of the other labs
    - DeRisi Oh yeah we collaborate with many different labs
    - Miller And how important is collaboration to the success of science these days
    - DeRisi Collaborations essential Theres almost no science thats done today solely sort of on a one person one lab basis Almost everybodys collaborating with somebody all the time and this is because science has gotten very complex A lot of information science biochemistry bioinformatics genetics crossdiscipline interdisciplinary research is the way the things are being done now And so my malaria work is done in collaboration with many different labs my virus work is done with different collaboration with different labs We almost never work solely on our own any more
    - Miller Well so is there an entrepreneurial spirit in your lab I mean clearly if youre one person cant be in charge with so many collaborations and so many specialists from different fields you really have to rely on individuals to sort of take the ball and run with it or is there some strict management technique thats in play
    - DeRisi Id like to think theres a strict management technique in play but theres really not Basically what I do is I try and recruit excellent individuals in wide varieties of different fields so in my lab we have clinical MDs in the lab we have structural biologists we have bioinformatists we have strict computer programmers we have single molecule biophysical type people we have immunology people genetics people biochemistry people molecular biology and all these fields sort of brought together bioengineering as well
    - Miller So when you first confront a problem are all these people in the same room and everyone offers an opinion about how best to structure the experiments to get at the answers how does that work
    - DeRisi Not usually Basically ideas for interesting experiments and things to tackle come from a variety of different angles Its not usually a group project that generates the ideas The ideas can come form anywhere But once the idea is there I will try and recruit what I think is within the lab or within the labs Im collaborating with the best team to work on that problem So if it involves making the new lets say microfluidic device to launch a new sort of diagnostic system out in the field or whatever I will recruit the people who would be best qualified to do the engineering to then get the surface chemistry right and so on from within the labs that I work with and my own lab
    - Miller Did you always want to be a scientist Even when you were a kid
    - DeRisi Most definitely I can remember doing experiments in genetics under safla in junior high You know breeding flies with wings and without wings and so on And at that moment doing those kinds of genetic experiments when you can obviously see the result right in front of you I knew then that I really wanted to be sort of a genetic engineer of sorts and at least thats what we called them back then And so Ive always had my heart set on molecular biology infectious disease genetics and so on
    - Miller Were there scientists in your family
    - DeRisi My dad is a clinical psychologist its a different kind of scientist And my mother was a nurse And so we had a strong science background but molecular biology this was the beginning of molecular biology when I was growing up So there really wasnt the same sort of model
    - Miller Joe thank you so much for joining me on Science Caf I wish you great luck in your future research
    - DeRisi Thank you for having me

    paragraphs: 
    - The dance of proteins is the major work of Dan Minor PhD an investigator in UCSFs Cardiovascular Research Institute Minor doesnt actually choreograph the dance of course although he likes to inject a few changes in the routine now and then just to see what happens No what Minor does best is study the movements particularly those of the ion channel proteins
    - Dan Minor
    - If studying ion channel proteins sounds like some nerdy passion for those with few social skills cup your ears for a moment and listen to your heartbeat That beat you hear is the dance and if the proteins responsible miss a beat or two and send your heart into arrhythmia well your dancing days might be over permanently
    - Ion channels which likely number in the thousands when you consider all the possible combinations pivot around the flow of calcium sodium and potassium in and out of cells a flow that underpins the electrical signals that not only make our hearts beat but our brains work They are essential to hearing as well
    - And did I mention speed Electrical signals can pass from our brain to our toes in a few milliseconds
    - Its a dazzling display and one that when studied with the right tools and strategies yields an image of what the proteins look like as they move and change
    - Will this knowledge mean more lives saved or fewer lives damaged Possibly Minor acknowledges After all the various molecular modules involved in signaling once they are identified and their architecture mapped are essential steps to understanding our chemical and electrical wiring But they are not the whole ballet
    - Still if understanding the big questions about disease means first understanding the small points then we should encourage this basic scientist to take a deep bow for his role in what is fast becoming a Minor classic

    - Gerard Evan

    paragraphs: 
    - Robert Hiatt
    - Breast cancer became more and more common during the last decades of the th century Although the pace of new breast cancer diagnosis finally has reached a plateau breast cancer remains the most often diagnosed cancer among US women The mystery of high breast cancer rates is of intense interest to the public as well as to the scientists who study population trends in this disease and who use this information to search for clues to its causes
    - Known risks such as reproductive and family history and normal aging account for only a portion of new breast cancer Some breast cancer activists and researchers are wondering whether a changing or deteriorating environment is partly to blame for the high incidence of the disease
    - Marin and San Francisco counties in California have among the highest rates of breast cancer worldwide Several years ago local Marin advocates approached UCSF researchers about studying the problem Their initial discussions sowed the seeds for a broader collaboration across the Bay Area and for what eventually evolved into the Bay Area Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Center part of a network of centers with research participants from coast to coast
    - Robert Hiatt MD PhD deputy director of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center is the principal investigator for the networks Bay Area center
    - Preliminary studies of animals and of human populations suggested the possibility that earlylife environmental exposures around the time of breast development might influence the risk of developing breast cancer later in life Therefore the research subjects in the centers studies are young girls first observed at ages and Followup study will continue through puberty The centers also use animal studies to investigate breast development and the evolution of cancer across the life span
    - Among the suspected contributors to breast cancer risk is the changing US diet We eat more we eat differently and we weigh more than in decades past Another suspect is exposure to manmade chemicals such as certain estrogenmimicking plastics One finding from ongoing research at the centers is that girls are reaching puberty earlier than in past decades

    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Im grateful that Ive got rhythm or at least good heart rhythm Millions of Americans dont The incidence of hearts that sometimes quiver ineffectually is on the rise Mainly its because people are living longer often with conditions that can threaten the hearts ability to transmit electrical signals in an orderly way
    - Jeffrey Olgin
    - These electrical signals move in waves like falling dominoes from muscle cell to muscle cell within the heart Different parts of the heart muscle contract in turn causing the hearts four chambers to pump lifeblood throughout our bodies
    - Cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure frequently contribute to the development of abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias Among the most common arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation
    - Atrial fibrillation refers to the irregular beating of the hearts smaller upper chambers It is not usually a death sentence but it typically causes fatigue and greatly increases the risk for stroke
    - Ventricular fibrillation refers to the quivering of the hearts big lower chambers which propel oxygenated blood into the major arteries Ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal if normal rhythm cannot be restored within a matter of seconds Unfortunately the first sign of heart disease in many people is sudden cardiac arrest a heart attack that disrupts the effective pumping rhythm of the ventricles
    - Many people survive heart attacks However the heart does not regrow muscle cells called myocytes that may have died during a heart attack With a loss of conducting cells the waves of electricity that once flowed through the heart in perfect order may become permanently prone to disruption causing arrhythmia
    - There are treatments for arrhythmias drugs implantable devices even the destruction of small bits of heart muscle that transmit wayward signals a technique pioneered at UCSF But these treatments do not always work
    - Jeffrey Olgin MD chief cardiologist of electrophysiology at UCSF is collaborating with Israeli stem cell researcher Lior Gepstein MD PhD to grow and transplant cells with tailormade electrical properties into rodents with the aim of developing a new treatment to correct some of the toughest cases of arrhythmias in humans In each case the treatment would be developed from cells taken from the patients own skin which should eliminate the risk of tissue rejection We speak with Jeff Olgin today on the UCSF Science Caf

    paragraphs: 
    - Far from the media eye UCSF epidemiologist Joseph Wiemels PhD makes trips to Fallon Nevada a rural town of about miles east of Reno on a lonesome stretch of Highway to investigate what he calls the most unusual concentration of residential childhood leukemia cases ever reported
    - Local nurses were the first to call attention to the spate of cancers The cases kept coming for years further heightening suspicions Local residents including many parents of stricken children banded together to form Families in Search of the Truth or FIST lobbying legislators and pushing for more investigation
    - Mention cancer clusters and if youre old enough you might think of Love Canal or the movie Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts But in the absence of a smoking gun its profoundly difficult to find evidence that a neighborhood or town is unduly suffering from insidious malignancies due to unseen environmental threats
    - Joseph Wiemels
    - Just by chance some communities are going to have more cancers than others over certain periods of time But when you already suspect youre living in a cancer cluster its easy to view all cancer cases from that suspicious perspective
    - Each year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC investigates some of the most unusual groupings of cancers But as Wiemels explains there has never been a case in which the CDC has concluded that a cluster could not be explained by chance and then proceeded to identify an environmental cause If Wiemels finds evidence to finger a specific environmental cause in the Fallon childhood leukemia cluster it would be a first
    - In Fallon as in an Agatha Christie murder mystery there is no shortage of suspects They range from arsenic and tungsten to jet fuel and even include the electromagnetic waves emitted from a powerful old radio transmitter a cornerstone of our nations defense during the century past one that still is used as a backup for the navigation of ships at sea

    - Dan Lowenstein
    - Epilepsy was familiar to the ancients including the Greek physician Hippocrates But it wasnt until the last century that EEG recordings began to offer more insight into the brains electrical activity during a seizure And it is only in the most recent decades that researchers have begun to make more significant strides in understanding epilepsy in terms of anatomical abnormalities genetic mutations and proteins called ion channels and their effects on how electrical signals are transmitted within groupings of nerve cells in the brain
    - Still the causes of the most common forms of epilepsy remain elusive Now in what he calls the biggest epilepsy research project in history UCSF neurologist Dan Lowenstein MD along with colleagues at major epilepsy centers across the country is looking for genes that are associated with common and some less common forms of the disease
    - The million clinical study called the Epilepsy PhenomeGenome Project is recruiting about patients For the most common forms of epilepsy the researchers are looking for families in which at least two siblings are affected
    - If the researchers identify genetic variations or mutations that can be implicated in the types of epilepsy they are studying it will trigger more research on what those genes and their associated proteins do to contribute to specific forms of disease That in turn is expected to lead to better insight into which drugs ought to work best for particular patients Success in the project may also lead to the design of entirely new drugs

    paragraphs: 
    - Ever think about your pancreas Matthias Hebrok PhD does If youre a biomedical researcher looking to do the world some good the pancreas is as good an organ to focus on as any Early anatomists thought the pancreas was just a cushion for the hardworking stomach Now we know better The pancreas governs our fuel supply secreting insulin to help control glucose and it produces digestive enzymes as well
    - Matthias Hebrok
    - Diabetes already has reached epidemic proportions and the incidence is still climbing In people with diabetes the insulinsecreting endocrine cells of the pancreas either die or function poorly
    - Other cells of the pancreas can become cancerous There are more than cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed in the United States each year Almost all of them are ultimately fatal Hebrok aims to find a way to regenerate insulinsecreting cells to treat diabetes and a way to stop pancreatic cancer cells from growing
    - But even before Hebrok focused on the pancreas he wondered early on how a complete human develops from a single egg Researchers now are learning how genes get switched on and off at just the right time and how molecules transmit signals from cell to cell to help establish an orderly developmental program
    - Many of these genetic switches and signaling molecules are being examined for their roles in causing stem cells to spin off more specialized cells Some of these genes and molecules are used over and over again in organisms ranging from fruit flies to mice and humans to give rise to diverse organs and tissues in the gut and throughout the body
    - Hebrok is gaining insights into how molecules play a role in forming the pancreas and the specialized cells within this organ One such molecule is hedgehog named for the spikes that develop in fruit fly embryos carrying a mutated version of the hedgehog gene Understanding how to manipulate hedgehog and other molecules and in turn how to use these molecules to direct cell growth and specialization may be the key to creating a new supply of transplantable cells for the treatment of diabetes
    - Another day we will invite him back to talk about pancreatic cancer But today Hebrok a leading researcher at the UCSF Diabetes Center will tell us what he has learned about the pancreas and how it develops and about the possibility of regenerating the hormonesecreting pancreatic cells that are so vital in controlling blood sugar

    - Jeff Norris Im here today on the UCSF Science Caf with Robert Nussbaum UCSF Holly Smith Distinguished Professor in Science and Medicine
    - Bob can you tell me how you came to be doing what youre doing today That is to say studying Parkinsons but also studying genetics
    - Robert Nussbaum I began in genetics about years ago and I was motivated by the fact that you could combine the clinical care of families with genetic diseases with a basic science study of what these diseases were and that one could use genetics to identify genes that were altered in these families and in that way both help the families by being able to do carrier detection being able to counsel the families being able to help them identify who in the family was at risk for these diseases but also by finding the genes involved they gave us a lot of insight into the pathways the particular steps that led to the diseases So genetics is a wonderful way of combining clinical medicine and the care of families with basic science research
    - The Parkinsons disease interest really comes from an invitation that I received sometime in the mid s from the head of the neurology institute Dr Zach Hall formerly of UCSF and then of the regenerative medicine program out here in California So I was in the intramural program at NIH at the time studying human genetics and Zach called me up and said that they were having a very large national meeting in Washington to discuss the question of whats happening in Parkinsons disease
    - And this was motivated to some extent by the neurology institutes interest in pushing the research agenda forward but also because patient advocacy groups and other individuals with a personal interest in Parkinsons disease really felt like the field had stagnated that since the discovery of Ldopa as a treatment for some of the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease there really hadnt been a lot of progress over the next couple of decades And what Zach asked me to do was to apply the principles and methods of human genetics to Parkinsons disease
    - Parkinsons disease had been known by the medical community Sort of the wisdom of the medical community was that Parkinsons disease was not a genetic disease and in fact if you found families where there appeared to be inherited forms of Parkinsons disease by definition it wasnt real Parkinsons disease
    - There is a wellknown and accepted approach to many diseases that relies upon identifying rare families in which the disorder is being inherited Because its being inherited because its in the family the tools of the Human Genome Project allow us to quickly identify the genes involved Once we know what the genes are we can then look at the pathways of the proteins that those genes encode and ask a simple question Are the same genes and the same pathways involved in the apparently nongenetic forms as the genetic forms
    - And of course probably the most spectacular success of that approach was to try to understand hypercholesterolemia which affects percent of the US population by studying the rarer families the one in to one in families where there was a defect in the receptor for cholesterol in particular for LDL And in these families with familial hypercholesterolemia you could identify the gene it turned out to be the LDL receptor and that led to an investigation of the entire cholesterol pathway and ultimately led to the identification of statin drugs which are now useful not just in the rare familial forms of hypercholesterolemia but in all forms
    - So my hope was if we could identify some of the genes that are responsible for the rare forms of familial Parkinsons disease it would illuminate the pathways and give us tools to try to understand sporadic Parkinsons disease So that was the proposal I made at that meeting and during the coffee break after I gave my talk a gentleman came up to talk to me and he turned out to be a neurologist from New Jersey whose name was Roger Duvoisin And Roger had been studying a large family with inherited Parkinsons disease which looked for all the world like Parkinsons in terms of its pathology and its clinical appearance etc with probably two minor differences
    - One was there was a relatively earlier onset Instead of occurring in the s and s the Parkinsons disease was occurring in the s and s in this family And second of all the family probably had a little bit more of the rigidity and the dystonia that you see in Parkinsons and a little less of the tremor
    - And we established a collaboration What I basically told him was If you can provide us with a sufficient number of DNA samples from this family we can find the gene responsible and we did that in collaboration with my colleague at NIH at the time Dr Mihael Polymeropoulos We first localized the gene to chromosome and then identified the gene and it turned out to be the gene for alphasynuclein So that was the first familial form of Parkinsons disease for which a gene was known
    - In sporadic Parkinsons disease patients brains contain aggregates of protein Theyre called Lewy bodies Well once alphasynuclein was identified as being a gene in which mutations can cause familial Parkinsons antibodies against alphasynuclein were used and it turned out that the brains of patients with sporadic Parkinsons disease had widespread abnormalities in alphasynuclein protein deposition The Lewy bodies turned out to be essentially alphasynuclein bodies aggregates of alphasynuclein
    - So thats how from my point of view human genetics and Parkinsons disease were married and thats what Ive been working on for the last years
    - Jeff Norris Before you started studying Parkinsons there was great dissatisfaction with that status Is that right Is that because that didnt really represent all of what was going on in Parkinsons or because the treatment was ineffective or because of a little of both
    - Robert Nussbaum The discovery of the loss of subtantia nigra neurons and those are the neurons that are sitting in a particular region of the midbrain and send their extensions their axons up to the striatum and deliver dopamine there Theres no question that the death of neurons is responsible for an important subset of the clinical syndrome called Parkinsons disease
    - Jeff Norris Are those all the motor defects
    - Robert Nussbaum Its primarily the motor defects It does not affect some of the other very serious problems in Parkinsons including dementia loss of intellectual function depression and sympathetic abnormalities such as abnormalities in heart rate in the ability to maintain blood pressure and also an almost universal finding in Parkinsons patients and that is severe constipation Those do not respond at all to Ldopa and the reason for that is because I think our view of Parkinsons disease has changed over the last four decades from being a disease of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra to a systemic disease Not just a generalized brain disease its a systemic disease that affects both the brain and the peripheral nervous system
    - Jeff Norris At the time you got into the field then there was an awareness that we needed to know more about these other effects and there still I imagine was no understanding of the cause or a way to halt the progression of the disease Is that
    - Robert Nussbaum I mean I think thats a really important point because the treatment with Ldopa or other sorts of interventions that increase the availability of dopamine are really symptomatic relief They dont treat the underlying problem They dont stop the neurodegeneration They dont reverse any of the neuronal death They dont rescue neurons It simply replaces whats not being delivered
    - And as I said you already have widespread damage before you even get the obvious symptoms Many patients will go for years with for example some decrease in their sense of smell and constipation and perhaps even depression as the only indicators of the fact that they are in the process of developing Parkinsons disease And only later when the motor symptoms become obvious is the diagnosis made
    - Jeff Norris And is that still the state of the art in terms of diagnosis
    - Robert Nussbaum Yes it is
    - Jeff Norris So you identified a protein that appears causative one would conclude from the study of the family in which you identified it alphasynuclein Is that it
    - Robert Nussbaum Alphasynuclein Uhhuh
    - Jeff Norris And you also found that it was deposited in patients with sporadic forms of the disease so that I presume offered an opportunity to find out at least through animal models if not in humans the role of that protein What have you been able to do since you did identify the protein as being present in these aggregates that form in the people with the disease
    - Robert Nussbaum So first of all in addition to finding that there were mutations in alphasynuclein I also was involved in a large study of a family with earlyonset Parkinsons disease and very severe dementia This is an American family in Iowa that had been identified originally and studied by John Hardy and Andy Singleton and Matt Farrer and what we found was that in this family the alphasynuclein itself was not abnormal
    - The gene had been triplicated so there were four copies of the gene instead of two in an individual and so people were simply making too much The proteins normal theres just too much of it And this clearly demonstrated that alphasynuclein needed to be tightly regulated in order to prevent Parkinsons disease from occurring
    - Well what happens if there are minor genetic variations in and around the alphasynuclein gene which either increase or decrease the expression of alphasynuclein by percent or percent Would or percent be enough to increase peoples susceptibility to developing Parkinsons disease I think of alphasynuclein variation now as being a potential target for studies on susceptibility And in my lab what we did was to ask Okay what variant thats associated with an increase risk of Parkinsons disease what does that variant do to the expression of alphasynuclein
    - And what was shown is that it increases the expression and so were starting to complete the circle here Mutation or overexpression of alphasynuclein can essentially cause the disease in families Two is that there are variants that increase the susceptibility to Parkinsons not in the setting of a family but in sporadic Parkinsons disease And three those variants are capable of increasing the expression not by percent but more like or percent so
    - Jeff Norris Can you talk a little bit about historically the role of mouse models and understanding this disease What was wrong with the other mouse models and what are your hopes for the model youve created
    - Robert Nussbaum This is a fundamental issue that comes from all animal model research is that there really is no animal model that we use probably with the exception of nonhuman primates that have anywhere near the life span that humans have And so what people frequently do is try to push the lesion to try to speed up the process because mice only live two years But by pushing it that doesnt necessarily mean that the process is exactly the same
    - The animal models that weve developed here recently in my lab have been based on a different philosophy a different idea and that is that we should try to mimic as closely as possible the normal expression of alphasynuclein but use the mutant form the same mutant forms that cause the disease in people and use those animal models not to model the Parkinsons disease process per se but to develop animal models that would be in essence sensitized models on which one can now test the environmental factors that almost certainly contribute to the development of Parkinsons one way or the other
    - Although our animals do not show any neurodegeneration in substantia nigra they are showing significant constipation and abnormalities in the enteric nervous system So I think were starting to mimic the early signs of Parkinsons disease and now we have to find out what environmental trigger will push those animals over the edge and reproduce the neurodegeneration that occurs in people
    - Jeff Norris And at those early stages are you not seeing the formation of clumps of alphasynuclein
    - Robert Nussbaum Thats right were not seeing aggregates and so I think that what this is telling us is that in the early stages of this disease there is dysfunction of the neurons without aggregation of the protein and without cell death which in many ways is good news cause what that means then is that its not irreversible
    - Jeff Norris You are planning to use the same sorts of toxins that have been used in earlier mouse models and at lower doses
    - Robert Nussbaum No Actually Im not a great believer in the hypothesis that chemicals in the environment are whats responsible I think its a much more widespread environmental exposure and I am very much informed by the careful studies that have been done by a German neuropathologist by the name of Heiko Braak whos in Frankfurt Germany whom Ive gotten to know through a formal postdoctoral fellow of mine
    - And Braak has made a very interesting I think critical observation and that is he believes Parkinsons disease first begins in the brain stem not in the midbrain where the substantia nigra is and that it begins in the region of the brain where the nucleus of the vagus nerve motor nerve number which is a parasympathetic nerve that innervates the heart and innervates the enteric nervous system in the gut and thats one of the areas where you see the earliest signs of change
    - What Braak has hypothesized is that Parkinsons disease may actually develop from the exposure of the nervous system to some kind of a toxin or infectious agent thats entering through the gut He mentions this because in addition to the vagal nerve abnormalities its now quite clear that in very early stages of Parkinsons disease you already start to see alphasynuclein aggregates in the nerves that line the gut the socalled Auerbach plexus or myenteric plexus This is a network of small neurons that innervate the entire gut and are involved with the nerve impulses that allow peristalsis and normal movement of food and fecal material through the enteric nervous system
    - Jeff Norris Is that known from humans as well as animals
    - Robert Nussbaum Yes Its been documented in humans
    - And so what Braak is suggesting is that perhaps theres a viral agent which finds its way up to the brain through the vagus nerve number And we know there are viruses that are capable of retrograde transport along axons that that same viral agent infects other neurons in the lining of the gut and cause the alphasynuclein to aggregate Thats one possibility
    - Another possibility is perhaps its chronic inflammation and that theres a level of inflammation that is a result of the continual exposure to bacteria in the intestine and that this low level of inflammation is capable of triggering in susceptible individuals a neurodegenerative response And theres now good evidence in animal models from a group in Dallas Texas as well as a group in Philadelphia that chronic inflammation delivered in the peritoneal cavity or directly in the brain can cause neurodegeneration
    - Jeff Norris Do you have a way of inducing this immune response then in the mice that you
    - Robert Nussbaum Yes and thats the plan The plan here with my mice is to use them as a sensitized model and to produce intestinal inflammation Our first step is going to be intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of lipopolysaccharide cell wall constituents from gramnegative bacteria

    - Jeff Norris
    - Among veterans injuries you cant see may be leading to additional alltooevident diseases many years down the road
    - While better treatment means that more injured servicemen and women are surviving injuries whats less visible are the large number of combat veterans who return with a mental health disorder
    - A recent study by UCSF researchers at the San Francisco VA Medical Center of more than veterans of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq found that onequarter have a mental health diagnosis and more than half of these veterans have more than one such diagnosis The most common is posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD
    - While these two long and continuing wars are increasing awareness of the immediate impacts of PTSD PTSD may also have insidious longterm impacts on physical as well as mental heath UCSF researcher Beth Cohen a physician at the San Francisco VA now is studying a strongly suspected link between PTSD and heart disease among recently returning veterans including female veterans
    - Cohen is using uptodate measures to probe more deeply into the link obtaining baseline data and following the vets over time Previous studies on vets from earlier wars were conducted long after combat tours were over but they were provocative
    - Beth Cohen
    - There were a few large studies one of Vietnam veterans one of veterans of earlier wars that went back and looked at medical records And this is decades after people served in the war and compared heart disease and mortality from heart disease in veterans who did and who did not have posttraumatic stress disorder And the researchers found that veterans with PTSD were at significantly higher risk of both developing heart disease and dying of heart disease
    - Jeff Norris
    - PTSD is different from gardenvariety chronic stress and Cohen thinks its impact on the body and on health will prove to be different as well
    - Beth Cohen
    - It does affect people in very specific ways more than being stressed so in order to get diagnosed with PTSD you actually need symptoms in each of three categories So one is reexperiencing your traumatic event and that can be through nightmares or thoughts that suddenly intrude during the day without warning The second cluster theres also avoidance So avoidance of anything that reminds you of the event or that might trigger a reaction One thing that veterans bring up also is the coverage of the current war Thats a big trigger for a lot of veterans So I have patients who say they cant watch the news or patients who have gone to a movie and then seen combat Its triggered a lot of bad memories and symptoms So there are specific symptoms that are different than just being stressed and this probably has a different effect on the body
    - Jeff Norris
    - Okay we have reexperiencing a traumatic event and avoidance So whats the third type of symptom of PTSD
    - Beth Cohen
    - Hyperarousal And an example of that would be this constant sense that youre on edge And another thing patients often report is hypervigilance People say that theyre constantly looking over their shoulders or they cant sit in a room and not be facing the door because they dont know whos going to come in
    - Jeff Norris
    - That all sounds like it might take its toll on the body but how exactly Cohen points out several possible mechanisms
    - Beth Cohen
    - One of the things were interested in and one of the links potentially between PTSD and heart disease is that constantly having this activation could have a negative effect on your body So for instance activating that fightorflight response we know that that affects your immune system We know that that affects the level of stress hormones in your body and those hormones in turn can actually affect things like your body weight or your blood pressure or your tolerance to blood sugar and risk for diabetes So those are some of the potential mechanisms by which PTSD could cause heart disease
    - Jeff Norris
    - Cohens new study called Mind Your Heart will start with lots of baseline data both from talking with veterans and from biological samples Over time Cohen is hopeful that followup will enable her and her colleagues to tease out factors that contribute to heart disease in these vets including factors associated with PTSD
    - Beth Cohen
    - Because its prospective we can collect exactly the data we want and follow them over time so we can see if their PTSD symptoms really precede the development of heart disease And again we can look at all those potential mechanisms that might link PTSD in heart disease And were most interested in three areas The biological mechanisms so things like higher system nervous activity more inflammation Behavioral mechanisms diet exercise even sleep can affect the heart And lastly what Id call psychosocial mechanisms and those would be other mental health conditions So we know PTSD often travels with depression for instance and thats a heart disease risk factor Also we know people who have poor social support and relationship issues are at an increased risk for heart disease and that might be a big risk for people with PTSD
    - Jeff Norris
    - So is there any chance that Cohens more indepth study will be unable to verify a link despite the provocative data from previous studies of veterans of earlier wars
    - Beth Cohen
    - I would consider it to be more than a hypothesis and a lot of people who work with veterans consider that to be a health issue like PTSD that they do develop a lot more chronic physical illness I think we would see it as a real phenomenon But because there isnt as much prospective data I think it still is worthwhile particularly with younger veterans coming back from our new wars to follow them over time and see if this plays out

    paragraphs: 
    - Colon cancer also known as colorectal cancer is the nations fourth most common cancer in both men and women Like other forms of cancer colon cancer has a hereditary component and individuals who are genetically predisposed to colon cancer have a lifetime risk of at least percent
    - Therefore it is extremely important to know whether you or your relatives are at risk of developing colon cancer Genetic testing can identify certain gene mutations linked to the two forms of hereditary colon cancer and can help you and your doctor map out the best plan for prevention and treatment For example atrisk individuals should start getting colonoscopies at a young age and should repeat the procedure every one to two years
    - In an audio interview with Andrew Schorr host of UCSF Medical Centers Patient Power series genetic counselor Amie Blanco of UCSFs Cancer Risk Program discusses the hereditary risk of colon cancer and what you can do to educate and protect yourself

    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - MicroRNAs are a very important newly recognized type of molecule naturally encoded within the human genome MicroRNAs or miRNAs help determine which gene products are produced in a cell Some miRNAs have been found to act abnormally in cancers and a few years ago miRNAs were found in diseasecausing viruses
    - Scientists have much to learn about miRNAs but few doubt the role of miRNAs in human health and disease The discoverers of miRNAs are the most recent recipients of what is arguably the most prestigious US recognition for basic biomedical research the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award
    - But it remains a challenge to figure out which genes are the targets of specific miRNAs A research team led by UCSF virologist Don Ganem MD has recently reported a powerful new approach in the scientific journal Nature Genetics
    - Ganem a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at UCSF demonstrated the new approach by using the Kaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus the causative virus of an AIDSassociated cancer that was first cultured by Ganem more than a decade ago
    - Ganems lab team used a series of rigorous lab protocols to narrow down suspected human gene targets of key viral miRNAs MicroRNAs inhibit genes from making protein in part by interfering with the ability of other kinds of RNA called messenger RNA mRNA to make proteins Ganems new approach differs from other methods in that it focuses on changes in the levels of these mRNAs rather than on the proteins they encode when they are targeted by miRNAs
    - Ganems broader ambition is to use these new methods to discover general principles of miRNA action He wants to use these principles to better predict and more quickly identify the targets of specific miRNAs and to figure out the biochemical mechanisms through which miRNAs help control gene activity The method his team developed is generally applicable to other miRNAs including those produced by the human genome Therefore other researchers may use Ganems methods to further their own fundamental investigations into this frontier of biology and genetics
    - The work of Ganems lab team in addition to developing a new method also sheds new light on control of the viruss life cycle a balance between quiet latency within cells and active viral proliferation and cellular destruction The more we learn about how viruses carry out their mission the better we will be able to come up with new strategies for fighting them Ganem says

    - A mouse isnt just a mouse For scientists striving to understand basic biology and human disease the mouse is a laboratory workhorse and an indispensable standin for humans Drugs are not tested in human clinical trials without prior animal studies and mouse models of disease are the proving ground in countless preclinical tests of potential pharmaceuticals
    - But researchers have not been learning as much from mice as they could UCSFs Laurence Tecott MD PhD and Evan Goulding MD PhD aim to change that They have developed clever devices to automate the collection and analysis of massive amounts of behavioral data on mice Researchers who focus on fundamental biology and drug developers both stand to benefit

    title: Hypertension Lowers Survival in African American Women with Breast Cancer
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Higher rates of hypertension in African American women compared with white women may account for some of the previously found racial disparities in overall survival among women with breast cancer according to new research
    - UCSF epidemiologist Dejana Braithwaite PhD is among the significant number of cancer researchers now exploring why it is that African American women diagnosed with breast cancer fare worse on average than white women diagnosed with the disease
    - Results of a new study led by Braithwaite and senior investigator Laura Esserman MD coleader of the Breast Oncology Program at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center indicate that hypertension alone accounts for about percent of the disparity in survival between African American and white women diagnosed with breast cancer The results were published online in the International Journal of Cancer in October and will appear in the March print edition
    - Other coauthors of the study were Martin Tammemagi PhD Dan Moore PhD Elissa Ozanne PhD Robert Hiatt MD PhD Jeff Belkora PhD Dee West PhD William Satariano PhD and Michael Liebman PhD
    - Hypertension is a very common condition among African Americans Braithwaite says People who are obese or who have diabetes often are hypertensive But in this study hypertension remained important even after the impact of obesity diabetes and other medical conditions was accounted for Braithwaite says While many of these socalled comorbidities had been taken into account in previous studies by researchers using the wellknown Charlson comorbidity index hypertension had not been included in that tool
    - Nonetheless Braithwaite says In our study hypertension prior to cancer diagnosis was an independent predictor of decreased survival
    - It has been known for years that African American women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer at younger ages and more often with tumors having biological markers associated with a worse prognosis In addition poor access to treatment and screening often is blamed for the disparity in survival between races
    - But even studies that correct for differences in tumor severity and treatment find survival differences which is what Braithwaite and Esserman have been seeking to explain
    - The new study included African American women and white women all of whom had health insurance through Kaiser Permanente Northern California Braithwaite and colleagues examined information obtained from the medical records of women diagnosed with breast cancer between and They looked at the records for these women from the time of diagnosis through and obtained additional information from the Northern California Cancer Center registry
    - After an average followup time of nine years percent of the African American women had died from any cause compared with percent of white women The researchers found that hypertension affected survival even after controlling for other comorbid conditions including age race tumor characteristics and cancer treatment
    - It is important to manage hypertension as it may be beneficial for overall survival particularly in African American patients Braithwaite says
    - According to Esserman It is critical to understand the biological explanation for the higher mortality seen in African American women if we are going to do a better job of tailoring treatments and making them more effective
    - Specifically this study helps us understand the host environment that might be more conducive to the development of cancer for example that the forces putting African American women at risk for hypertension may also be contributing to increased risk for breast cancer
    - The researchers have not ruled out the possibility that hypertension might actually affect the course of already diagnosed breast cancer in some cases although it is not clear how that could be Preliminary results suggest that it may be worth investigating whether there indeed is an association between hypertension and not only the overall risk of death but also the specific risk of dying of breast cancer
    - Braithwaite is now investigating that question in a new study I would not jump to make that conclusion at this stage she cautions It is imperative that we confirm these findings as they will likely uncover novel opportunities to intervene for improved survival among African American women with breast cancer With mortality rates nationwide over percent higher in this population compared to white women we need to find solutions to this problem

    - According to Esserman It is critical to understand the biological explanation for the higher mortality seen in African American women if we are going to do a better job of tailoring treatments and making them more effective
    - Specifically this study helps us understand the host environment that might be more conducive to the development of cancer for example that the forces putting African American women at risk for hypertension may also be contributing to increased risk for breast cancer
    - The researchers have not ruled out the possibility that hypertension might actually affect the course of already diagnosed breast cancer in some cases although it is not clear how that could be Preliminary results suggest that it may be worth investigating whether there indeed is an association between hypertension and not only the overall risk of death but also the specific risk of dying of breast cancer
    - Braithwaite is now investigating that question in a new study I would not jump to make that conclusion at this stage she cautions It is imperative that we confirm these findings as they will likely uncover novel opportunities to intervene for improved survival among African American women with breast cancer With mortality rates nationwide over percent higher in this population compared to white women we need to find solutions to this problem

    - The deadliest brain cancers called gliomas remain somewhat mysterious to researchers which may be why they are difficult to treat Recently a molecule called olig has emerged as a prime suspect from the lab of physicianresearcher David Rowitch MD and his longtime collaborator Charles D Stiles PhD of the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston In the brain olig helps keep cells immature and capable of regenerating themselves indefinitely
    - Rowitch a neonatologist came to UCSF primarily to learn more about developmental diseases that arise in the brains of young children and to find better ways to treat these disorders cerebral palsy for instance But the way cells go awry during brain development is similar to the way cells go awry in brain cancer Rowitch and other researchers are finding out

    paragraphs: 
    - In recent years there has been an increasing number of drugs pulled from the market and many observers have been blaming the drug approval process of an understaffed underfunded industrydependent US Food and Drug Administration FDA But even old drugs predating todays FDA environment also are subject to recall
    - Now the FDA may consider shelving Darvon a painkiller first approved half a century ago An FDA advisory panel by a narrow vote determined that the benefits of the drug do not outweigh the risks and recommended pulling it from the market The FDA often takes an advisory committees advice but not always
    - The consumer watchdog group Public Citizen has long fought the marketing of Darvon which has the generic name propoxyphene hydrochloride as well as a version of the drug frequently sold under the trade name Darvocet The group has filed petitions and lawsuits in opposition to its ongoing availability
    - Darvon which has been on the market since in the United States is not a firstchoice painkiller Its not on many formularies any longer says Lori Reisner PharmD a UCSF clinical pharmacist and painkiller specialist Its still prescribed probably most often by practitioners who have used it a long while and are comfortable with it
    - Physicians sometimes prescribe it for patients who suffer intolerable nausea or constipation due to opioids Reisner says but these opioid side effects often can be managed
    - Darvon has a narrow therapeutic window Reisner notes meaning that the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose is relatively small Overdoses may lead to liver or other organ toxicity Its considered less effective than many alternatives that are available Reisner says comparable to generally safe alternatives such as codeine or tramadol
    - Darvon can worsen mental depression and increase nervous system depression in combination with other agents such as alcohol according to Reisner Acute accidental overdoses have been known to disturb normal heart rhythm
    - The FDA database of adverse events is reported to include more than deaths including suicides intentional and unintentional drug overdoses and heart attacks associated with this class of drugs
    - The FDA recently appointed Sidney Wolfe MD who helped lead Public Citizens opposition to the drug to a fouryear term on the agencys Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee Wolfe is slated to deliver the UCSF Chancellors Health Policy Lecture on Tuesday Feb in Cole Hall at noon

    title: Lung Cancer Now Is the Focus of Powerful Genetics Research
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Allan Balmain and David Jablons
    - Lung cancer research at UCSF is poised to leap forward thanks to a big bank No not some teetering financial institution down the street What UCSF has is an invaluable tissue bank
    - When it comes to lung tumors the quantity and quality of UCSFs chillyvault holdings are hard to beat Theyre a treasure trove that will help researchers determine how cancer survival odds and responses to treatments are affected by specific genetic abnormalities within tumors and even by normally inherited variations in genes
    - The lung cancer tissue bank now enables researchers at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center to explore more deeply the role of specific genes in lung cancer according to David Jablons MD chief of thoracic surgery at UCSF and leader of the Thoracic Oncology Program
    - There are so many genes that are interrelated that we never suspected had anything to do with one another Jablons says This systems genetics approach to cancer is a whole new frontier
    - The frozen samples were gathered from hundreds of lung cancer patients over more than a decade For most patients the tissue bank also holds matching normal lung and blood samples for comparison Jablons and colleagues have annotated the tissue bank data with information on the clinical care and outcomes for patients
    - Why so many samples Tumors share distinctive features that set them apart from normal cells but individual tumors differ from one another in how they look and in how they grow and spread They also differ from one another in how they act metabolically
    - More to the point for the newest studies tumors all have abnormal genes but each tumor exhibits its own individual pattern of abnormal gene activity It takes many samples to track down the impacts of these genetic differences
    - The tumor cells contained in the samples within the UCSF bank will help researchers identify microscopic molecules that can be used to help guide treatment and will help these scientists envision new treatment strategies for throwing a wrench into the gears that drive relentless tumor growth
    - But a persons normal genes inherited from mom and dad also can play a role in how well that person will fare when stricken with cancer Relatively few researchers have explored the role of normal genetic variations in cancer Most cancer scientists study the genetically abnormal tumor tissue In any case there is a shortage of normal matching tissue from cancer patients for studying how ones genetic background influences cancer
    - Jablons has led several fruitful research collaborations with doctoral scientists in recent years Recently with postdoctoral fellow Dan Raz MD he demonstrated that analysis of a small group of genes is a better predictor of lung cancer survival than gauging clinical stage and tumor size among patients diagnosed at an early stage
    - Jablons patient longterm devotion to collecting normal as well as tumor tissue now might yield even bigger results through a new collaboration with fellow UCSF laboratory cancer researcher Allan Balmain PhD The Bonnie J Addario Lung Cancer Foundation is sponsoring the project
    - Balmain has pioneered the exploration of genetic background in cancer He introduced a new field mouse species to the lab to jumpstart the field Balmain has bred longstanding strains of genetically identical lab mice with the field mice which are more cancerresistant and genetically diverse Balmain tracked genetic variations in the offspring and has successfully identified constellations of normal genetic variations that affect cancer risk
    - There are no breeding experiments in humans of course Even so Balmain is hopeful that the same sort of genetic analysis in the human tissue collected by Jablons surgical team will lead to breakthrough insights
    - Balmain has a good track record in making important discoveries by looking at old problems from a new perspective He most recently extended his successful record with lung cancer findings that he and colleagues Minh To PhD and Christine Wong PhD presented in the October issue of the scientific journal Nature Genetics
    - Researchers have long known that within cancers defects in the genetic code mutations frequently occur in a gene called Kras These Kras mutations are believed to drive the growth of many tumors including many lung cancers
    - It turns out that cells have a couple of ways to splice together the genetic instructions for making the Kras protein The cells use either a piece of genetic code called A or a different piece of the gene called B In the past researchers focused on the more common B form known to contribute to cancer when it becomes mutated
    - But in a clear demonstration that the activity of normal genes can indeed influence cancer risk Balmain found that a normal form of A when present in the cell at the same time as a mutant B can suppress the cancerassociated mutant This protective function may be important in stopping cancer and might even be worth mimicking in developing new drugs to fight cancer Balmain suggests
    - On the other hand the A form of Kras might give rise to the normal pool of cells from which common lung cancers called adenocarcinomas commonly arise Balmain says Its only later that the B form of Kras becomes activated and triggers tumor growth from among the cells in this pool
    - B may be responsible for proliferation and maintenance of tumor cells that arise Balmain says but A is responsible for the initial cell fate decision because the mice with no A are completely resistant to cancer

    - Cancer doctors may be writing the prescriptions for new generations of drugs but some financially hardpressed patients are not having those prescriptions filled
    - The trend is worsening according to Marilyn Stebbins PharmD health sciences clinical professor of pharmacy at UCSF Stebbins the pharmacy utilization director for Mercy Medical Group at the CHW Medical Foundation in Sacramento has for years been helping uninsured and underinsured patients find and navigate programs that can fill the financial gap
    - Over the past three years our referrals from oncology have increased dramatically due to the high cost of many of these drugs she says
    - It is not unusual for pharmacy bills to top per year for cancer patients There are people who will just not start therapy until they come to see us to find out if there is any assistance Stebbins says
    - Stebbins is not only referring to the most impoverished cancer sufferers although they are clearly affected She also helps many people who already have health insurance
    - Among the elderly who are so often stricken with cancer its the federal governments Medicare program that fails to adequately relieve the cost especially for patients who rely largely or solely on Social Security for their incomes
    - These are fixedincome individuals Even if they receive what they consider to be a reasonable Social Security check a single drug might still cost them as much as per month Stebbins says
    - Part B of Medicares drug benefit includes a percent copayment whichs mounts rapidly for the newest cancer drugs Medicare Part D drug coverage is more complicated but also features a costly gap Not only inoffice injectable drugs but also several costly oral cancer drugs fall under part B coverage Stebbins notes
    - While many older chemotherapy drugs are available in cheaper generic form an increasing number of expensive targeted therapies are becoming part of standard cancer treatment after having been shown to prolong life an average of a few months or more sometimes much longer in clinical practice for certain patients
    - Stebbins uses the example of a patient with a common form of lung cancer as an example A new targeted cancer therapy Tarceva may cost per month If the patient gets anemia he or she may require Epogen a charge If the patient loses too many white blood cells the order of the day may be the immune booster Neupogen priced at for five days of treatment
    - Even someone fully insured through Medicare would still have tremendous outofpocket costs Stebbins says
    - Stebbins guides patients through the use of resources that are available online or through a tollfree telephone number to providers as well as to patients but that can be difficult to navigate
    - For patients without any health insurance pharmaceutical companies may make drugs available for free Stebbins refers patients to the pharmaceutical companies patient assistance programs which have requirements and forms that vary from drug to drug Patients with health insurance even if it is inadequate do not qualify for this form of assistance according to Stebbins
    - For underinsured patients Stebbins favorite goto is the more userfriendly HealthWell Foundation a nonprofit organization that can help pay not only for drugs but also for physician care and other costs But there are other resources too
    - The high cost of cancer if not satisfactorily addressed has certainly not gone unnoticed in health policy circles Just last week saw the release of a report by researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation and the American Cancer Society entitled Spending to Survive Cancer Patients Confront Holes in the Health Insurance System
    - Also last week a study presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference The Science of Health Care Disparities found that an estimated million Americans go without recommended cancer treatment Hispanic and African American paients are particularly vulnerable the researchers discovered And finally last week the San Francisco Chronicle published a story highlighting the bankrupting cost of cancer care and listed several resources for patients

    title: New Gene Therapy Technique for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Other Brain Disorders
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Krystof Bankiewicz
    - To treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers UCSF researchers have developed a new strategy for delivering gene therapy to the brain cells that stand to benefit most
    - Gene therapy to treat degenerative brain disorders is still regarded as a promising approach and is again being tested in experimental clinical trials
    - It is difficult to get drugs that are large molecules such as proteins into the brain Gene therapy puts genes into brain cells so they can make their own therapeutic proteins But then there is still the problem of delivering the genes Many drug developers continue to choose a common virus called adenoassociated virus as the gene delivery vehicle But the brain poses special challenges for drug delivery
    - The favored approach has been to inject the gene therapy drug through several cannulae kind of like very long extremely thin straws threaded through holes drilled in the skull and guided into place with fancy imaging equipment Despite all that special effort it remains difficult to control where the drug goes and how far it goes toward reaching targeted cells
    - Now a team at UCSF led by neuroscientist Krystof Bankiewicz MD PhD has developed a way to get nerve cells themselves to help disperse gene therapy to targeted cells
    - In monkey research reported in the Feb online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Bankiewicz and colleagues injected adenoassociated virus bearing either therapeutic or marker genes into specific cells within a brain structure called the thalamus situated below the cerebral cortex Neurons in the thalamus make specific connections to cells in the cortex through branching processes called axons
    - Bankiewiczs research team found that gene therapy delivered to thalamic cells could be made to spread efficiently through axons to all cortical regions where it made the geneencoded proteins
    - For the first time specific regions of the cortex can be supplied with therapeutic agents by targeting defined regions of the thalamus Bankiewicz says Critical and widespread cortical regions can be reached through each individual cannula using this new approach
    - The technique is called convectionenhanced delivery The fluid containing the gene therapy is injected under pressure delivered in pulses The pulsation acts a pump to deliver the therapy over greater distances
    - This procedure can now be performed under the direct guidance and control of interventional MRI to assure precise delivery of the viral vector Bankiewicz says
    - Translational experiments now are in progress to evaluate the potential of this unique gene delivery technology for the treatment of cortical dementias such as Alzheimers disease and lysosomal storage disorders in children

    paragraphs: 
    - Different cell types in the brain are vulnerable in different degenerative brain diseases Alzheimers Parkinsons and multiple sclerosis for instance
    - Biomedical researchers are aiming to develop new strategies for fighting these diseases by finding ways to coax vulnerable cells to survive or if they die to replace them with the same type of cells
    - The brain is composed of not only signaling neurons but also glial cells which insulate and protect neurons and provide structural support Both neurons and glial cells arise from neural stem cells and some types of neurons and glial cells are born throughout life from stem cells in the adult brain
    - This new paradigm that the adult brain has the plasticity to grow new cells has only gained ascendance in the last decade or so
    - Arturo AlvarezBuylla
    - UCSF researchers have long been at the center of successful efforts to identify and characterize stem cells in the brain Now as reported in the Feb online edition of Nature UCSF Department of Neurological Surgery researchers led by Daniel Lim MD PhD and Arturo AlvarezBuylla PhD have found a genetic switch that is required for neural stem cells to become neurons
    - Daniel Lim
    - In young mice neural stem cells lacking a gene product called Mll can still proliferate and survive but they do not form neurons as they normally would the researchers discovered Cells without Mll instead give rise only to glial cells
    - For neural stem cells to form neurons their daughter cells must turn on or express certain sets of genes while repressing others Patterns of gene expression including the pattern required to give rise to neurons are established in part by how DNA on chromosomes is packaged together with proteins to form a structure called chromatin
    - Mll is part of a family of enzymes that modify chromatin to either activate or silence gene expression These socalled epigenetic modifications can be passed on through cell division providing a cell with a kind of memory of its specialized identity and the functions it is fated to perform
    - In the Nature paper the authors provide evidence that Mll operates in part by activating a downstream gene called Dlx UCSF researcher John Rubenstein MD PhD previously showed that Dlx genes are essential for the development of inhibitory neurons in the forebrain Mll activates Dlx expression by chemically modifying the chromatin marking the Dlx gene for persistent expression
    - Lim began the work in the lab of AlvarezBuylla who has been a mentor to Lim AlvarezBuylla has conducted seminal experiments to identify stem cells in a region of the brain called the subventricular zone and is among those who helped to clearly demonstrate that new neurons can indeed be born in the adult brain throughout life
    - After completing a residency in neurosurgery at UCSF Lim joined the faculty and started his own laboratory last year Lim AlvarezBuylla and Rubenstein also are faculty members of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF
    - The new studies that Lim now leads are in the realm of basic biology but he is a practicing neurosurgeon and his goal is to see his work applied in the clinic He is hopeful that a growing understanding of the molecular determinants of cell fate in the brain will one day enable manipulation of brain cells The goal is to reprogram the cells to specific cell fates thus guiding the formation of new cells to replace or augment those lost to degenerative brain disease
    - Dr AlvarezBuylla and I both strongly believe that understanding the basic biology of neural stem cell regulation is key to unlocking their therapeutic potential Lim says I believe that these findings about how neural stem cells turn on specific genes for the production of new neurons will lead to a greater ability to someday repair the diseased or damaged brain

    title: HIV and Organ Transplants Can Coexist, UCSF Research Shows
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - By Robin Hindery
    - Huge progress has been made in recent years in the fight against HIVAIDS improving quality of life for people infected with the virus but also presenting a new set of health challenges as those individuals live longer than their th century counterparts
    - Kidney disease and liver disease now pose two of the greatest threats to HIVinfected individuals and until recently the chances of these patients receiving new organs were slim
    - But thanks to groundbreaking work by UCSF researchers that is no longer the case and medical institutions across the country are jumping on board to help dispel the myth that HIV is an impenetrable barrier to a successful transplant
    - Increasingly people are aware that HIV isnt the contraindication to transplantation that it was before said Laurie Carlson RN a UCSF transplant research coordinator and the author of a recent paper in the Nephrology Nursing Journal making the case for kidney transplants for HIVinfected patients I really think UCSF has moved this agenda forward It truly is a big thing and a lot has been accomplished not just clinically but politically policywise and advocacywise
    - UCSFs work began in when the University of Californias systemwide AIDS Research Program awarded million to a research team led by UCSF physicians Peter Stock MD and Michelle Roland MD to conduct the first pilot study of liver and kidney transplantation in patients with HIV From to the study monitored the one and threeyear survival rates of patients who underwent either kidney or liver transplants
    - The team found that after one year percent of liver transplant patients were still alive and after three years percent were still alive Among kidney transplant patients the survival rate was even higher percent both one year and three years after surgery
    - Those results were promising even when compared with survival rates among the HIVnegative population Stock said and he and his team proceeded to expand their study to include other transplant centers around the country The UCSFsponsored observational study funded by the National Institutes of Health and other sources has enrolled about participants so far and Stock said he expects to reach the target of patients by the end of the year
    - The study is addressing some increasingly pressing questions among the medical and patient advocacy communities as kidney and liver disease affect more and more people with HIV
    - Every year approximately new patients starting dialysis in the United States cite HIVassociated kidney disease as the cause of their renal failure according to the US Renal Data System In addition studies have shown that roughly percent of HIVinfected individuals in the United States are also infected with either hepatitis C or hepatitis B liver diseases that can lead to organ failure
    - Those troubling figures are the unfortunate result of a far more positive trend Thanks to highly effective antiretroviral therapy the average life expectancy among HIVinfected individuals increased years between and according to a study published in by researchers at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIVAIDS
    - Its the downside to progress Carlson said Now people live long enough to develop chronic illnesses on top of the ones theyre already dealing with
    - The UCSF researchers findings have helped chip away at medical myths surrounding transplants for individuals with HIV but Carlson cautions that not all HIVinfected patients are good candidates for a transplant
    - The best candidates are patients who have wellcontrolled HIV disease higher CD white blood cell counts and who can handle their medications she said We want to be sure we can manage the HIV and not accelerate its progression by performing a transplant
    - One finding that took researchers by surprise was the high organ rejection rate among HIVinfected patients undergoing kidney transplants Stock said he and his colleagues expected that the patients already weakened immune systems wouldnt put up much of a fight when a new organ was introduced but we were very wrong
    - This problem may be caused in part by the way HIVpositive patients metabolize the immunosuppressant drugs that are meant to prevent organ rejection Stock said But he acknowledged that there may be additional factors at play
    - Were still trying to get a handle on that and its something we have to fix he said
    - Carlson said she hoped UCSFs ongoing research and her recent paper which ran in the NovemberDecember issue of the Nephrology Nursing Journal would help educate doctors and nurses with HIVpositive patients
    - Were moving from a study phase to more of a clinical care phase and I thought it was time to share some of our promising results and experience here at UCSF and give some guidelines to other folks she said

    - Nobodys getting any younger But as we age what are the biological reasons one person looks older than another person of the exact same chronological age More important beneath the skin what biological differences tell us the most about who is most likely to live the longest and healthiest
    - Elissa Epel
    - UCSF clinical psychologist Elissa Epel PhD is searching for better gauges to measure and make predictions about biological health and aging Epel and her UCSF colleagues are finding that as a predictor of health and aging a comparatively obscure enzyme called telomerase might eclipse the importance much more famous molecules cholesterol for instance Telomerase acts on DNA at the ends of chromosomes called telomeres Telomeres might be a link between stress diseases associated with aging and aging itself Epel believes She is even exploring antiaging therapies based on her research

    title: QB3 Team to Apply for FDA Approval of New Therapeutic Drug for Chagas Disease
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - By Kaspar Mossman
    - QB researchers at the UCSF Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases are preparing to apply for FDA approval to test an Investigational New Drug IND for Chagas disease in what could become the first drug to emerge from UCSF without an industry partner
    - Electron micrograph of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi Photo by Stephanie Hopkins and Juan Engel
    - If approved this would pave the way for UCSF to conduct a Phase I clinical trial for the compound the first targeted therapy for the deadly disease It would also offer an alternative to current therapies which are not specific to the Chagas parasite and inflict severe side effects on patients according to James McKerrow MD PhD UCSF professor and a member of California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences QB
    - The current therapy is for to days said McKerrow a parasitologist who first identified the compound in during research on the biology of the Chagas parasite Its almost impossible to expect someone to take that drug for that long We were looking for something that you would take for to days more like what youd expect with an antibiotic
    - The compound known as K inhibits a vital enzyme called cruzain in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi the parasite that causes Chagas disease Because cruzain has no direct counterpart in humans McKerrow said K may have minimal side effects If clinical trials bear out its promise it could cure millions suffering from what is considered the most serious parasitic disease to affect people in the Americas
    - Chagas disease is endemic throughout Mexico Central and South America and affects an estimated million to million people according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Initial symptoms are mild but years later T cruzi moves on to colonize the heart and intestines eventually killing upwards of people per year The disease is spread via the triatomine bug an insect known by several names including the assassin bug and the kissing beetle since it often bites people near the mouth as they sleep
    - T cruzi is a very effective and historically old parasite said McKerrow It started out as an infection of animals in the wild and has evolved into a parasite of humans as well From an evolutionary standpoint its very interesting in terms of the way it switched its hosts how it evades the immune response and how it lives within host cells The flip side is that its a huge health problem
    - Despite the extent and severity of the disease McKerrow said therapies for Chagas have generally not been pursued by large pharmaceutical companies due to the minimal profits such research might generate As a result the challenges are left to research centers and universities such as UCSF but in a publicuniversity setting that process of discoverytoIND takes decades to carry out
    - That has certainly been true with K which McKerrow Sandler scientists Juan Engel and Patricia DoyleEngel and colleagues discovered two decades ago in their research on the cruzain protease
    - We were trying to understand what the protease does for the parasite he said In the course of doing that we produced enough cruzain that we could begin to look for inhibitors Initially we were interested in using them as research tools

    - There are many strains of T cruzi which raises the concern that an effective drug for one strain might not work for others But McKerrow and his Sandler colleagues have shown that K is effective in the laboratory against nine different strains including some that are resistant to the current therapies nifurtimox and benznidazole A colleague in Brazil verified that K worked in several local strains

    - Universities are ideal places to conduct basic research and to generate lead compounds with potential but normally they dont have the funding or the full breadth of expertise required to translate that research into the clinical arena Saxton said Where a private company might have a large fully dedicated team working on a percent funded project to meet the FDA deliverable on a tight deadline we have one small team squeezing it in with other work that we do for the University trying to raise the funds through various government grants and private donations in order to keep the program moving forward
    - In September Saxton joined McKerrow and Robertson in a meeting with FDA officials to agree on the content of the data package required for an IND application for K Two major studies remain to be completed rounding out the toxicology data with a formal preclinical study and developing the good manufacturing practices required to ensure that K is produced at the quality required for human clinical investigation
    - The cost of these steps will be million Robertson and Saxton said They need for the toxicology study and million for optimizing manufacturing and the dosage for patients Saxton and Robertson are applying for philanthropic and governmental funding to take K over this hurdle
    - If we were a big company we would have told the FDA wed file in a month because wed already have the money McKerrow said But since were not a big company we have to get the money somehow

    title: QB3 Team to Apply for FDA Approval of New Therapeutic Drug for Chagas Disease
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - By Kaspar Mossman
    - QB researchers at the UCSF Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases are preparing to apply for FDA approval to test an Investigational New Drug IND for Chagas disease in what could become the first drug to emerge from UCSF without an industry partner
    - Electron micrograph of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi Photo by Stephanie Hopkins and Juan Engel
    - If approved this would pave the way for UCSF to conduct a Phase I clinical trial for the compound the first targeted therapy for the deadly disease It would also offer an alternative to current therapies which are not specific to the Chagas parasite and inflict severe side effects on patients according to James McKerrow MD PhD UCSF professor and a member of California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences QB
    - The current therapy is for to days said McKerrow a parasitologist who first identified the compound in during research on the biology of the Chagas parasite Its almost impossible to expect someone to take that drug for that long We were looking for something that you would take for to days more like what youd expect with an antibiotic
    - The compound known as K inhibits a vital enzyme called cruzain in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi the parasite that causes Chagas disease Because cruzain has no direct counterpart in humans McKerrow said K may have minimal side effects If clinical trials bear out its promise it could cure millions suffering from what is considered the most serious parasitic disease to affect people in the Americas
    - Chagas disease is endemic throughout Mexico Central and South America and affects an estimated million to million people according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Initial symptoms are mild but years later T cruzi moves on to colonize the heart and intestines eventually killing upwards of people per year The disease is spread via the triatomine bug an insect known by several names including the assassin bug and the kissing beetle since it often bites people near the mouth as they sleep
    - T cruzi is a very effective and historically old parasite said McKerrow It started out as an infection of animals in the wild and has evolved into a parasite of humans as well From an evolutionary standpoint its very interesting in terms of the way it switched its hosts how it evades the immune response and how it lives within host cells The flip side is that its a huge health problem
    - Despite the extent and severity of the disease McKerrow said therapies for Chagas have generally not been pursued by large pharmaceutical companies due to the minimal profits such research might generate As a result the challenges are left to research centers and universities such as UCSF but in a publicuniversity setting that process of discoverytoIND takes decades to carry out
    - That has certainly been true with K which McKerrow Sandler scientists Juan Engel and Patricia DoyleEngel and colleagues discovered two decades ago in their research on the cruzain protease
    - We were trying to understand what the protease does for the parasite he said In the course of doing that we produced enough cruzain that we could begin to look for inhibitors Initially we were interested in using them as research tools
    - A friend of his Jim Palmer working at Khepri Pharmaceuticals a Bay Area biotech company donated some compounds for McKerrow to try
    - One of them was the parent of K McKerrow said It was the best thing we saw

    title: UCSF Researchers Are Mapping DNA from 100,000 People for Unique Kaiser Database
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Mother Natures tightly held secrets to healthy aging are in danger of being wrested away The genes we inherit the lives we lead and the places we live all affect our chances to evade major diseases and to maintain health as we grow older
    - Neil Risch
    - To help sort out how variations in these contributing factors influence health risks Kaiser Permanentes Division of Research is creating one of the worlds largest genetic and environmental information resources for health research called the Research Program on Genes Environment and Health RPGEH
    - This is going to be the largest and most comprehensive database for doing genetic epidemiology research says Neil Risch PhD head of the Institute for Human Genetics at UCSF and cochair of the Department of Epidemiology Risch is an adjunct investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and codirector of the RPGEH
    - In September the RPGEH and UCSF received million in federal stimulus funds The source was a new twoyear grant from the National Institutes of Health The funds will enable Risch and colleagues to genotype DNA from RPGEH participants The genotyping project is a collaboration between the UCSF Institute for Human Genetics and the RPGEH
    - As a result of this funding in just a few years scientists around the world will be able to tap into a new data resource which will be the biggest of its kind to focus on genetic variation and environmental exposures in an older population The average age of individuals whose genetic information will be genotyped for the project is
    - More than Kaiser members already have contributed saliva samples to the RPGEH for DNA genotyping
    - We are grateful that so many Kaiser Permanente members in Northern California see the longterm potential in building this kind of a resource for scientific research says Cathy Schaefer PhD executive director of the RPGEH Our participants make this program possible They are making a real contribution to better health for future generations by participating in this program
    - The foundation for the RPGEH is another preexisting and evergrowing clinical database Kaiser Permanentes electronic health record HealthConnect This is the largest civilian database of its kind For many Kaiser Permanente members it has information spanning decades and includes information on clinical diagnosis and treatment as well as labtest results and prescription information
    - This rich resource now is matched with UCSF researchers expertise in detecting DNA differences among individuals The UCSF Genomics Core Facility under the direction of PuiYan Kwok MD PhD will manage the genotyping of the DNA
    - The RPGEH is going to be an evolving database Risch says Even if the genes in the database remain the same the clinical information is being updated constantly
    - If you tried to create a database like this from scratch it would be enormously expensive he adds
    - The database will be a gateway to discoveries that are likely to lead to insights into new treatments for common diseases such as diabetes asthma heart disease and cancer conditions that are wellrepresented among the Northern California members of Kaiser Permanente
    - This twoyear project is mainly about creating the infrastructure Risch says The bigger payoff is going to come later after the data is collected
    - Already there are commercial microarray chips available to track genetic variation in human research studies These gene chips which look a bit like microscope slides contain markers to detect genetic variability in DNA samples at points throughout the entire human genome The chips provide a means to survey all DNA on all of our chromosomes
    - The latest versions include up to a million markers to detect genetic variations The markers are spaced throughout the billion DNA alphabet building blocks called base pairs which spell out the human genome
    - Risch and his RPGEH colleagues have enlisted chip maker Affymetrix of Santa Clara Calif to make a customized chip The deluxe chip will include additional markers to enhance researchers power to track down important genetic variations that exist within human populations The new markers have been selected based on recent discoveries of human genetic variations from the NIHsponsored Genomes Project and on earlier discoveries of genetic links to disease risk and responses to drug treatment
    - Many of the new markers are uncommon in the population overall but are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups among whom they may have a greater impact on disease risk and treatment response
    - We want to make sure we have genomewide coverage Risch says But we also want to be able to followup on prior studies on a whole variety of human diseases which have pointed to particular locations within the genome
    - Because the customized gene chip will incorporate additional closely spaced markers in these regions of special interest it will be used to generate data that researchers far and wide can use to zoom in more closely on specific changes in DNA that may contribute to risks for the diseases they study
    - Risch hopes that researchers using the database also will identify genes or lifestyle factors that increase the likelihood of living a long healthy life We have a lot of people in the database who are in their s and s Its a great opportunity to look at healthy aging

    title: Study Finds Higher Omega-3 Fatty Acid Levels Associated With Less Biological Aging in Cardiovascular Disease Patients
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - By Lauren Hammit
    - UCSF scientists have discovered that higher blood levels of omega fatty acids correspond to a lower rate of shortening of telomere length in patients with coronary artery disease
    - Ramin FarzanehFar
    - The finding they say indicates the possibility that omega fatty acids may protect against cellular aging
    - The study is reported online and in the Jan issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association
    - Telomeres are tiny units of DNA that seal off the ends of chromosomes which contain the bodys genes similar in concept to the tips that keep shoelaces from unraveling Telomeres protect the integrity of genes and maintain chromosomal stability and accurate cell division They also determine the number of times a cell divides and thus determine life span
    - Telomere length is considered a chromosome marker of biological aging because they have been found to be shorter in the immune cells of older people as compared with the young explained study author Ramin FarzanehFar MD a cardiovascular epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at UCSF
    - Telomere length is an emerging marker for determining biological age and many scientists are interested in understanding the impact of influences such as age exercise obesity diseases like diabetes and heart disease oxidative stress and how interventions like dietary supplements statins and omega fatty acids impact length he said We are excited to identify omega fatty acids as a potentially protective factor that may slow down telomere shortening
    - Several previous studies including those by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and University of Wales College of Medicine have shown that cardiovascular disease patients with high dietary intake of omega fatty acids exhibited better survival rates However it is not yet understood how omegas produce this benefit FarzanehFar noted
    - The goal of the UCSF study was to understand the mechanisms underlying this protective effect by determining whether blood levels of omega fatty acids were associated with changes in leukocyte telomere length Leukocytes are a type of blood cell Researchers recruited patients from a UCSF research project known as the Heart and Soul Study between September and December and followed them through January
    - Participants gave blood samples that researchers measured for omega fatty acid levels The team then isolated DNA from those leukocyte samples and measured telomere length at the beginning of the study and again after five years of followup Statistical models adjusting for a number of variables were used to examine the association between baseline levels of omega fatty acids with subsequent change in telomere length accounting for differences in age sex smoking race medication exercise and morbidities like type diabetes
    - The researchers found that individuals with the lowest levels of omega fatty acids experienced the most rapid rate of telomere shortening whereas those with the highest levels of omega fatty acids experienced the slowest rate of telomere shortening
    - According to the authors omega levels were associated with less telomere shortening before and after adjustment for risk factors and potential confounders Each single standard deviation increase in omega levels was associated with a percent reduction in the odds of telomere shortening
    - In summary among patients with stable coronary artery disease there was an inverse relationship between baseline blood levels of omega fatty acids and the rate of telomere shortening over years FarzanehFar said
    - These findings raise the possibility that omega fatty acids may protect against cellular aging in patients with coronary heart disease

    title: UCSF Chancellor Cites Need for Faster Pipeline of Better, Cheaper Drugs for Cancer Patients
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Before coming to UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann MD MPH was a practicing oncologist and later she was president of product development at Genentech where she took the lead in developing some of the most successful cancerfighting drugs in history
    - UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann delivers the keynote address at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Centers Breast Oncology Program on Jan
    - Among these drugs are Avastin Rituxan Tarceva and Herceptin the last of which was the first anticancer treatment tailored to target a molecule that is abnormally produced in a difficulttotreat subset of breast cancers
    - Given her background its no surprise that DesmondHellmann was asked to deliver the keynote address at this years annual symposium for the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Centers Breast Oncology Program Scientific Retreat last week Watch the address on YouTube
    - The theme of her talk was the need for smarter drug development that harnesses all available information on clinical outcomes genetics tumor biology and early surrogate signs of positive responses to treatment to identify the most promising drugs and move them through the pipeline more quickly to meet the needs of cancer patients
    - During her talk DesmondHellmann referred to the years from to as the golden years It was then that the drugs Rituxan Herceptin and Gleevec became widely available for treatment with each having a great impact on patient survival and in changing the ways that researchers and physicians think about cancer UCSF can play an important role in initiating a new golden age of drug development DesmondHellmann says
    - Rituxan the first monoclonal antibody approved for treatment of a human cancer nonHodgkins lymphoma was special because of its rapid approval and launch DesmondHellmann says The pivotal trial for Rituxan had patients It was uncontrolled because the standard therapy for nonHodgkins lymphoma at the time was to watchandwait to avoid the complications of noteffectiveenough chemotherapy
    - The cure rate significantly increased DesmondHellmann says And one of the most interesting aspects thats still under study is this possibility of turning cancer into a chronic disease in the same way that HIV infection is regarded as a chronic but not necessarily rapidly fatal condition
    - Herceptin is a type of personalized medicine aimed at a protein called Her that is abnormal in a subset of breast cancers Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis
    - The rapid FDA approval was due to a large unmet need and to patient advocate demands DesmondHellmann says
    - Before Herceptin there was no treatment option specific to Herpositive breast cancer and it was a rapid death sentence for most women After there was about a percent difference in diseasefree survival at five years and the new therapy reduced the chance of cancer returning by percent
    - Gleevec was the perfect storm of discovery advocacy and commitment DesmondHellmann says with a fast FDA approval and a phenomenal success rate in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia CML Before Gleevec only percent of patients with CML survived five years after diagnosis and treatments have serious side effects Now there is a complete hematological response in more than percent of patients and a percent fiveyear survival rate she says
    - These are the kinds of outcomes we should strive for in hematologyoncology DesmondHellmann says
    - So why are we no longer witness to golden years for the development of cancerfighting drugs
    - UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann center talks with molecular biologist Laura van t Veer and Frank McCormick director of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
    - Cancer research is too slow too expensive too inefficient and too uncertain DesmondHellmann says She used another Genentech drug as an example of slow translation of discovery into clinical practice The concept of blocking a tumors blood vessel supply by targeting proteins responsible for new blood vessel growth was first described in However the first drug to work in part by this mechanism called Avastin was not tested in clinical trials until marking years from concept to first trials in humans The drugs were finally approved for sale by the FDA in
    - DesmondHellmann mentioned four examples of treatments as holding as much promise as the drugs of the golden years They are targeted at different molecules and biochemical pathways Certain types of cancer depend on the biochemical activities of these targeted molecules for their survival
    - One category includes drugs that inhibit the action of a protein called BRAF BRAF drives as many as percent of malignant melanomas and eight percent of solid tumors DesmondHellmann says
    - Another group of promising drugs in development targets the hedgehog biochemical pathway in basal cell carcinoma a type of skin cancer and in some forms of medulloblastoma a deadly brain cancer
    - About five percent of patients with lung cancers may greatly benefit from drugs that target a protein called ALK
    - The last group of promising drugs mentioned by DesmondHellmann inhibits the action of the protein called PARP These show promise in treating the most difficulttotreat triple negative breast cancers which lack three more common markers found in many breast cancers
    - To help make drug development faster cheaper and more predictable DesmondHellmann says We need to understand earlier and with greater confidence what the best ideas are
    - I think we should be extremely dogged even if its for a narrow group of patients to uncover those cancers driven primarily by a single biochemical pathway Disrupting such an important lifeline for these cancers could have a great impact on patient survival
    - To explore the potential of combination therapies DesmondHellmann says We need to understand how to test more than one product at a time and to do it efficiently in a way that gives us clear signals
    - DesmondHellmann cited the need for better early markers of success or failure in clinical trials I think survival is the best outcome measure but if survival is extended I am not willing to wait beyond our lifetimes to know the answer and more importantly patients should not have to wait
    - What is learned in clinical trials or even after drug approval can be used to guide future research DesmondHellmann says There is no reason in todays world with electronic medical records and information technology that we shouldnt know what happens with every patient We need both outcomes and molecular correlates on every cancer patient There is so much information on safety efficacy potential good and potential harm and we need to have that
    - DesmondHellmann notes that affordability and patient access to the best treatments are important issues We need to make sure that the right product reaches the right patient at the right time and that the patient has access to it
    - For each cancer patient the goal is to be able to say Heres the kind of cancer you have and in fact we have something for that UCSF has an unprecedented opportunity and great talent to contribute to accomplishing this goal DesmondHellmann says
    - In an interview after her keynote address DesmondHellmann elaborated on points she made during her presentation and discussed ways in which academic researchers can work with industry and patientadvocate groups to advance promising treatment ideas more quickly
    - Medical oncologist Hope Rugo talks with UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann while Thea Tlsty professor of pathology looks on
    - DesmondHellmann says that a drugs transition from experimental to wellunderstood is more gradual than what is suggested by the division between experimental and FDAapproved drugs The tag approved has the sense that we know everything about it even for newly approved drugs she says DesmondHellmann envisions a category of new drugs that could be used in a somewhat restricted way and which could not be advertised directly to patients Its important to communicate the uncertainty and to dampen down the marketing instinct she says
    - When it comes to UCindustry collaborations especially those involving patient studies DesmondHellmann says I think we could all do a better job of understanding what everyones objectives are
    - We should focus on our shared goals but also to really be clear about where we have differences Talk out loud about where you are going to disagree and how you are going to manage communication of results confidentiality publication and how to involve patients
    - People worry that too often when the UC system looks at interactions with industry its a lot about what you cant do and whats not possible Great investigators at UCSF who really want to change medicine change science and make an impact would like to work with people who say You want to cure cancer you want to change the world How are we going to get that done When youre in administration or legal or tech transfer and have that attitude it makes a huge difference
    - DesmondHellmann cited innovative clinical trials led by UCSF breast surgeon Laura Esserman MD and colleagues as a successful attempt to break through traditional ways of organizing and carrying out research
    - These are precedentsetting trials and it takes the kind of relentless pursuit of better treatments for patients to say okay no one has ever done this before Well how do you do it Why cant we do it Whats possible
    - People sign up for that Its so inspiring and so thrilling when youre participating in that The nocando attitude comes from a lack of involvement and a lack of inclusion Thats one of the reasons Im interested in collaborative science and team science

    title: UCSF Chancellor Cites Need for Faster Pipeline of Better, Cheaper Drugs for Cancer Patients
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Before coming to UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann MD MPH was a practicing oncologist and later she was president of product development at Genentech where she took the lead in developing some of the most successful cancerfighting drugs in history
    - UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann delivers the keynote address at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Centers Breast Oncology Program on Jan
    - Among these drugs are Avastin Rituxan Tarceva and Herceptin the last of which was the first anticancer treatment tailored to target a molecule that is abnormally produced in a difficulttotreat subset of breast cancers
    - Given her background its no surprise that DesmondHellmann was asked to deliver the keynote address at this years annual symposium for the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Centers Breast Oncology Program Scientific Retreat last week Watch the address on YouTube
    - The theme of her talk was the need for smarter drug development that harnesses all available information on clinical outcomes genetics tumor biology and early surrogate signs of positive responses to treatment to identify the most promising drugs and move them through the pipeline more quickly to meet the needs of cancer patients
    - During her talk DesmondHellmann referred to the years from to as the golden years It was then that the drugs Rituxan Herceptin and Gleevec became widely available for treatment with each having a great impact on patient survival and in changing the ways that researchers and physicians think about cancer UCSF can play an important role in initiating a new golden age of drug development DesmondHellmann says
    - Rituxan the first monoclonal antibody approved for treatment of a human cancer nonHodgkins lymphoma was special because of its rapid approval and launch DesmondHellmann says The pivotal trial for Rituxan had patients It was uncontrolled because the standard therapy for nonHodgkins lymphoma at the time was to watchandwait to avoid the complications of noteffectiveenough chemotherapy
    - The cure rate significantly increased DesmondHellmann says And one of the most interesting aspects thats still under study is this possibility of turning cancer into a chronic disease in the same way that HIV infection is regarded as a chronic but not necessarily rapidly fatal condition
    - Herceptin is a type of personalized medicine aimed at a protein called Her that is abnormal in a subset of breast cancers Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis
    - The rapid FDA approval was due to a large unmet need and to patient advocate demands DesmondHellmann says
    - Before Herceptin there was no treatment option specific to Herpositive breast cancer and it was a rapid death sentence for most women After there was about a percent difference in diseasefree survival at five years and the new therapy reduced the chance of cancer returning by percent
    - Gleevec was the perfect storm of discovery advocacy and commitment DesmondHellmann says with a fast FDA approval and a phenomenal success rate in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia CML Before Gleevec only percent of patients with CML survived five years after diagnosis and treatments have serious side effects Now there is a complete hematological response in more than percent of patients and a percent fiveyear survival rate she says
    - These are the kinds of outcomes we should strive for in hematologyoncology DesmondHellmann says
    - So why are we no longer witness to golden years for the development of cancerfighting drugs
    - UCSF Chancellor Susan DesmondHellmann center talks with molecular biologist Laura van t Veer and Frank McCormick director of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

    title: New Cancer Fighting Strategy Emerges from Antibody Signaling Discovery
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - A new discovery about cancer and the immune system points to previously unrecognized targets for drug development to battle solid tumors
    - Lisa Coussens
    - The research also suggests that a drug already in use for more than a decade to treat nonHodgkins lymphoma might also be useful in treating some solid tumors
    - This strategy is unusual in that it would employ drugs that target cells or functions of the immune system to fight solid tumors rather than cancers that arise in cells of the immune system
    - A research team led by Lisa Coussens PhD a professor of pathology at UCSF and a pioneer in studies of inflammation and cancer has found a cancerpromoting role for a specific molecule of the immune system The study appears online in the scientific journal Cancer Cell Already Coussens is collaborating with pharmaceutical industry scientists to explore therapeutic strategies arising from this molecular discovery
    - Biochemical and cellular studies over the past decade have shown that inflammation can promote the development of cancer In addition certain chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohns disease pancreatitis prostatitis asbestosis and Barretts esophagus are associated with an elevated cancer risk
    - Coussens a member of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center has explored chronic inflammation in cancer caused by cells guiding the two different kinds of immune response T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system as well as myeloid cells of the innate immune system which typically regulate more general immune responses at sites of infection or injury
    - Cells of the immune system may sometimes activate immune responses that inhibit the development of cancer but in many precancerous cellular milieus the immune system can be driven into an ongoing inflammatory state that actually helps abnormally growing cells to develop into potentially deadly cancers
    - In general the past decades research has made it clear that Chronic inflammation in the context of tumor development is associated with a poor prognosis Coussens says
    - Coussens has found that both types of immunity contribute to an inflammatory environment that can promote the development of cancer In her lab group reported that B cells in particular are essential for the cancerpromoting effect in squamous cancers a type of skin cancer B cells are best known for making antibodies that target specific infectious disease agents But antibodies can play other roles in guiding immune responses
    - Now Coussens and her lab group have identified a biochemical mechanism that links certain actions of B cells to the growth of cancer The key appears to be the familiar class of antibodies known as immunoglobulin G IgG and receptors to which these antibodies attach on cells of the immune system
    - The receptors that promote solid tumor growth when activated by IgG antibodies known as Fc gamma receptors FcRg are found on mast cells macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system The activation of FcRg plays a role in recruiting mast cells and other immune cells to neoplastic tissue which in turn enhances progression to cancer and development of new blood vessels to feed nutrients to growing tumors
    - Coussens lab team in experiments performed by postdoctoral fellows Pauline Andreu PhD Magnus Johansson PhD and Nesrine Affara PhD found that mice genetically predisposed to develop squamous cancers were much less likely to develop cancer when they also lacked FcRg receptors or when they lacked IgGproducing B cells
    - The notion that immunoglobulins may enhance the development of some cancers has not been previously considered Coussens says We know that cancer patients have higher IgG levels and this new research says that in some cases this might be promoting tumor development or at least tempering the effects of some cytotoxic therapies
    - Most tumors are rife with activated immune cells Coussens says Their cancerpromoting roles have been largely overlooked as have studies to investigate possible tumorpromoting roles for some immunoglobulins as regulators of solidtumor development These discoveries open up many new signaling molecules to think about as potential therapeutic targets
    - In their Cancer Cell report the researchers write These findings have broad clinical implications as they reveal critical signaling pathways regulated by humoral immunity and FcRg to target therapeutically in patients at risk for cancer eg patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases as well as individuals harboring premalignant lesions where chronic inflammation compromises tissue integrity and enhances risk of malignancy
    - Greater success in treating certain solid tumors might result from combining chemotherapy with drugs that can thwart cancerpromoting activities of the immune system Coussens says For example Rituxan is a drug with relatively few side effects that is used to treat cancers of B cells such as nonHodgkins lymphoma
    - In mice genetically engineered to model squamous cancers Coussens and collaborators from Genentech now are conducting combinatorial trials with Rituxan and chemotherapy she says and finding exciting results that look promising
    - It is paradigm shifting she adds We believe there are going to be solid tumors for which patients will benefit from Rituxan therapy

    title: UCSF Science Caf&eacute; &ldquo;Cooks&rdquo; in San Diego
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - Jeff Miller left Oriana Aragon and Kishore Hare conclude the first part of their Science Cafe presentation in San Diego
    - San Francisco is a hotbed for the growing Science Caf movement so its no wonder that the Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC looked to the Bay Area for inspiration when it came time to plan their meeting set for late March
    - First contact came last summer before I knew that Science Caf had won an award of excellence from the AAMC and after hashing out the details what emerged was a professional development session entitled How to Build a Science Caf cohosted by me and my colleague Kishore Hari founder of San Franciscos Down to a Science
    - Our goal was to show as much as tell in the minutes set aside for our discipline track session which ended up in the Public Relations category not Public Affairs but what do I know To that end I drafted a student scientist from UC San Diegos Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory Oriana Aragon to be my live interviewee That required of course that I carry to San Diego my podcast recording gear two microphones two mic stands a digital recorder and assorted cables
    - We met Oriana in the lobby of the San Diego Marriott and walked the short distance to the meeting room Oriana and I had talked on the phone and I had reviewed her labs work with mirror neurons and how that relates to autism so I knew we had a great topic But Oriana also came with a standout personal story She had once been a jazz singer in France This kind of detail is an interviewers dream And true to expectations when the room filled and I turned on the microphones we struck up a great rapport and danced through some of the details of her work effortlessly and engagingly
    - Jeff Miller discusses autism and mirror neurons with Oriana Aragon a neuroscience researcher at UCSD
    - After about eight minutes I turned the room over to Kishore who worked the audience like a seasoned pro Our intention was to simulate the kind of questionandanswer format that his physical caf settings evoke It all went well in fact so well that we had to cut the questions short so that we could proceed with our more formal presentations
    - What does this tell me The Science Caf movement has tapped into a hunger for context about scientific discovery and the desire to meet challenge question hear and otherwise interact with scientists themselves While UCSF Science Caf is a virtual gathering place not replicated at other universities as far as I know its strength is that it gives science a real human voice And because its weekly those voices multiply into a roar I like the sound of that

    title: First Science Caf&eacute; Reader Survey
    flash: 
    paragraphs: 
    - As part of a university that prides itself on research we are taking a oneday break from the regular editorial cycle to ask you what you like or dont like about Science Caf The survey will only take a few minutes so fire away
    - On Monday March look for my interview with Nick Kanas on how his psychiatric studies of astronauts are shaping treatment for the rest of us Other topics covered this month will include autism viruses and cancer and learning and memory
    - And if you havent yet received or read the UCSF supplement that appeared in the Wall Street Journal and that showcased both milestones in UCSF science and some of todays most promising work the link to the PDF can be found here
    - I am happy to report too that UCSF Science Caf will be part of a new National Science Foundation audio and video science website being readied for a late spring launch Podcast downloads for are also more than double last years pace
    - Thank you for your interest and loyalty

    - Jeff Miller
    - Its always hard to let go of something you have nurtured tended and loved But as every parent knows there comes a day when you need to send your creation off into the world
    - That day has come for Science Caf This will be my last entry and my last episode
    - After years at UCSF I am leaving to take a new position as head of Public Affairs at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
    - As I look back over the last two years I am proud that we were able to bring an idea to life so successfully I could not have imagined that what first flashed into my mind on a train ride between Munich and Frankfurt would now command a podcast listening audience of thousands per weekand an equal number of readers at least that is when we were able to post the transcripts I apologize for that failure
    - Of course there could not have been a Science Caf without so many superb scientists willing to participate UCSF is fortunate to have such in abundance Indeed as I contemplate my long career it is the conversations with scientists that I remember most and hold most dear
    - Scientists are the spirit and soul of UCSF Their curiosity fuels all the discoveries that ultimately improve human health and while they might be far removed from the bedside make no mistake That drug you take that healing therapy you enjoy that hope you feel often began in the mind of a scientist who wondered why something works as it does or why it fails so completely
    - Sadly science is not funded properly in this country True billions of dollars are awarded annually but as any public university scientist will tell you the money available for research and the graduate education that is its lifeblood is drying up
    - Now I didnt want my final Science Caf to sound like a pledge night but the fact remains that science needs your support and that includes emotional support as well as dollars If you need convincing if you need to be reminded that there is transformative science going on everywhere at UCSF just listen again to the podcast archive which will endure after my departure
    - Science Caf too will live on thanks to my UCSF colleague Jeffrey Norris and our multimedia expert Tony Taliaferro
    - I encourage you to keep reading keep listening keep believing In the end science will set you free
